While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.

Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Isalam are not extreme. Sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and live in kindness and justice with God's creation.

A core duty of being a Muslim is to conduct Zakat (the word for charity in Arabic). The Prophet Mohammad stated that: 'The believer's shade on the Day of Resurrection will be his charity.' Because of their inspiration, Muslims are known to tirelessly work for many charitable causes in order to serve humanity on the global scale and their local societies across the UK.

I think you'd be surprised at the number of similarities Islam shares with Christianity. It teaches love and forgiveness, not oppression.

We could easily substitute the word 'Christians' for the word 'Muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith.

Actually women and homosexuals have not receive the right treatment in many places for a very long time, not just in Muslim culture. Plus, the society has not change too much. The most important thing is how we can make the society and the world a better place, not just excluding others.

Last I checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. Much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on Muslims and other minority communities to try to paint false image. Don't be fooled by their fake news.

I can feel you. However, the majority of Muslims are not against women or other cultures. They are like us who want to be treated equally and they have the right as human. Keeping Muslims away is not helpful either. Instead, we could think of ways to increase the disparity.

Why do you say that they are never taken responsible? Crimes are punished irregardless of religion in our country. If a Muslim person kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished.

So you are suggesting Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the Sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a Muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. See what I am getting at?

This kind of tweet is a fraud for humanity.
The essentialization of people because of their religion, it is a reprehensible hate speech.
Is your goal to break national harmony? You will not succeed.
With such a false statement, it is sure that we cannot trust your judgement! This way of essentialisation will not convince anyone.
Muslims are just like other human groups, honest in most cases.
Such reflection deserves the Nobel Prize! Seriously, you put in grave danger your intellectual credibility.
This claim is a scam against freedom of expression, and punishable by law. This, in addition, is completely false since the fraud in any form is banned by Islam.
Copé went through that.
Fasting is a personal choice.
You are free to eat in front of me, it does not bother me.
A Muslim who did this did not understand his religion.
You live on what planet?
There is a religious reason behind this. Besides, doctors prevent people who are going to have surgery from eating too.
On the contrary, secularism allows every citizen to freely profess his faith.
No secularism is against the veil.
It seems that you don't know the definition of laicity.
The goal is freedom of conscience, the purpose is non-discrimination on the basis of religion.
And your statement is completely false. The freedom to express one's religion is guaranteed by secularism.
There is a confusion. Secularism means that the state does not have an official religion, but citizens have the choice of religion and to manifest it; the state is the guarantor of these liberties. So wearing the veil is a freedom fully guaranteed by law.
The constitution and the laws guarantee the freedom to manifest one's own religion and therefore the use of the veil.
Review your law lessons! Secularism guarantees the freedom to express one's religion to everyone and therefore the use of the veil.
Like the use of all the other religious symbols (cross or kippah for example), the use of the veil is guaranteed by secularism.
Only Islam tolerates other religions.
False, Islam is a religion that accepts all religions and respects them.
Islam establishes the human right to equity, to justice, even if it is an enemy or a non-believer according to this verse : « and if you judge between people, judge fairly, even if it is during war. And that the hatred you have towards people does not push you to be unfair ».
Muslims have ruled over the Arab lands during the last 14 centuries. Yet today, the statistics tell us that 14 million Arabs are Coptic Christians (for generations), witnesses that Islam has not been answered by the sword. The Muslims ruled India for about a millennium. Today, more than 80% of Indians are not Muslims, witness that Islam was not imposed by the sword. The most populated areas Muslims are the east coast of Africa, Indonesia and Malaysia, while no Muslim military force has gone into these areas, which were conquered only by the intellectual sword.
Many times in history, Muslims have welcomed Jews persecuted by Christians in Europe.
No, Islam is a religion with a history like any other. Thank you.
Personal judgement that you wish to erect as a universal rule.
Your lack of knowledge and culture forces me to invite you to a tea to convey some elements of my religion.
In every community, there are always extremists, but it is not exclusive to Islam, and this is contrary to its message.
Check your sources! Islam supports freedom of religion as in the Koran 'no bond in religion'. It supports the values of solidarity and peace. It has been a source of light for humanity with many discoveries.
Evidence? There are none. Islam was rather a source of light for the rebirth of Europe, as evidenced by all the works. Islam has never practiced the Inquisition as demonstrated by the intelligent coexistence of religions in Muslim Spain.
Really? How do you explain that the prophet says that all extremism is not part of Islam? Islam is a religion of the middle class and a light for humanity.
Islam is a religion of tolerance and light. The contribution of Muslim scholars to the well-being of humanity is known. Any obscurantism has nothing to do with this current.
Islam is a religion that adapts to the country.
On the contrary, young people like to fast like everyone else.
This is wrong, they do it for themselves because they know the benefit of it.
It is for their religious purpose.
We educate our children to fast gradually but never force.
No compulsion in religion.
They can wear skirts, but long skirts.
The Islam teaches modesty.
Modesty is a sign of virtue in us.
The Muslim woman's clothing must be ample, just as it is a sign of modesty for men!
Remaining modest prevents girls from finding themselves in uncomfortable situations.
I wear the scarf while wearing mini skirts. I am much more serene and less the prey of men! Now I walk quietly without making him whistle as if I were a doggie!
Don't be mad, but I think that women do not dress to cause any particular emotion in you.
Words may hurt people as well.
Why don't you try to wear it, just to see if it really attacks you.
Oh, but do you know that it is only a piece of fabric?
Your problem is intolerance, not the veil.
It is you, who attack me, my veil stays on my head and does not do anything.
This is not its goal. My veil is a piece of clothing that is part of me.
This is the way you see it, in any case, it isn't its purpose. I freely wear it, religiously, for myself.
Don't you like the color?
#islamophobia. The freedom to wear the veil is a fundamental human rights. It does not interfere with your freedom.
I want to assure you nothing in the constitution obliges you to look at a woman wearing a veil.
I saw so many different veils in the shapes and colors, you will surely find one you like.
Fix other obsessions.
A simple fabric causes this to you? Don't worry, there are people underneath.
Some speeches can also be a form of aggression.
How a piece of fabric can be an assault to someone?
Wearing a veil, and therefore expressing one's religious opinion is one of the fundamental freedoms of the individual. Each of us expresses his or her individuality. The wearing of the veil, in the same way, is the expression of an individuality.
A scarf a piece of fabric that covers the head, not harmful, not explosive.
Come on, I'll invite you for a cup of tea.
How does it attack you?
The veil is on my head, not on yours.
Oh, yeah? Forgive me, but how did he attack you? I'm going to hand him over to the police and I'll take TELINDUS with you against him!
It is a matter of personal choice. It is not important who wears it.
Learn to live together.
Not at all, it is about knowing how to live and respect for each religion.
Tolerance is the foundation.
This is an attack on my freedom.
Your words are an assault to me.
And the veil of Christian sister is not an aggression to you?
And if you got to know me, maybe I'd be less aggressive.
Why is it aggressive to you?
So much hatred in one sentence. That's a shame.
Try to know the person in question, a human being like you who claims nothing and who has no desire to live fully, if existence and in peace.
A veil is not aggressive. Your words are.
My veil is synonymous with freedom, how does it assault you?
My veil is a matter of intimacy.
Don't thongs assault you?
It is just a piece of clothing that cannot attack people.
Should we react to this discourse? Silence is the best answer
It is freedom of worship.
Others' personal choices should not become your personal problem.
Freedom of conscience.
This veil should be a non-event, why you give him a message. She doesn't wear it whether I believe in God or not.
My veil is my choice, not yours. If you feel it as an aggression, it is you who has a problem.
If this is an aggression, I advise you to live in a cave because there will always be veiled women.
If a veil has this effect on you, how can you stand to walk around town with so much melting pot?
It is similar to saying that your haircut is an attack against humanity.
I am not responsible for your perception of my veil.
My veil is my freedom.
My veil is a respectable choice.
Tell me what is provoking you in my piece of fabric, did you ask yourself the question when you see a nun or the statue of the Virgin Mary?
What about the yarmulke or the Sikh turban or the African boubou?
Similarly, your string may be uncomfortable to other people.
You have to accept everyone's dress codes, if it is none of your business.
You cannot force others to your own choices, mind your clothes.
They don't want to see us in the public space anymore.
An insult to the Muslim woman.
Assault is a very big word.
I'm sorry, but you have to do some work on yourself.
What bothers you?
You can always divert your gaze.
Women wear pants if they want to, men wear skirts if they want to. What's the problem?
What is aggression? Define what is done AGAINST you!
Clothing worn by others may bother you, because you are not used to it, but not to attack you. It doesn't make sense.
Don't look at me and I have the right to choose my clothes. I am in a free country.
I sense a heart full of hate. You would feel aggrieved by your shadow.
How can a fabric be aggressive?
This speech might also be perceived as a kind of attack on intelligence and openness.
These words are not very tolerant towards humanity.
Let's talk about it so I can prove otherwise.
My veil is personal and reflects my personal convictions.
My veil has nothing to do with you.
Tu n as nul besoin d adherer a mes convictions.
Tu n as nul besoin d adherer a mes convictions.
Tu n as nul besoin d adherer a mes convictions.
You do not need to adhere to my beliefs.
You're the one who's violating my right.
Let me quote the lyrics from Maître Gims: If it disturbs you, well, it is the same
How is that my freedom to dress myself as I understand an aggression?
Why is a piece of cloth aggressive?
Your comment, on the other hand, is aggressive because it places your well-being beyond my freedom without any justification.
Not at all the veil and protection.
It is wrong!
Even if I don't necessarily like certain behaviours, I don't consider it a personal aggression, a little TOLERANCE won't hurt you.
There are so many clothing traditions that if we remove them all, you would be left in an empty world.
Your way of looking at things is the only model to follow, you cannot live in a free and democratic society.
I understand that I do not represent your feminine ideal, but know that this veil is my pride.
If I were trying to strangle you with my veil, your words would be justified; but now you are really exaggerating a lot.
How would you feel if I were to say to you that your cap is an agression against me ?
Maybe you'd rather see me in a miniskirt with my breasts out.
It is a piece of cloth and you feel attacked; you're a little sensitive.
That's your problem not mine!
It suits me so well!
I'm fine in my head and it hurts you in yours, weird no!
I invite you to see a shrink.
The freedom of some ends where the freedom of others begins.
It is just a piece of tissue.
It is possible to change sidewalks in a democracy.
My veil is my choice.
Your comments are an incitement to hatred, this is punishable by law.
It is me who is hot inside. Could you at least be understanding.
Your reflection is an aggression against the principle of secularism.
What you don't understand is the meaning of this outfit.
What is an agression to you is not the veil but the choice to wear it or not.
Being against modesty is not everyone's opinion and fortunately.
Freedom is frightening. The one who wears the veil is a proof of it.
Freedom may not be for you.
What about other dressing styles that are not common in some cultures?
You are the one who lacks tolerance towards a person who does not think like you.
My veil is a personal choice.
No more than your mini skirt and others.
Your word is an aggression against my religion.
It is on MY head and it does not bite.
I did not force you into anything, let alone talk to me, go your way instead of attacking people.
Can you feel attacked by a piece of cloth? It is my veil and it is on my head, you are free to go your way.
Other people may feel assaulted by your words as well.
The thong is an assault against me. Half naked women placed on posters are also an assault against me.
And yet you're the one who's attacking me.
In a secular republic, everyone dresses according to their own convenience.
How can my clothing harm you?
Do I ask you about your own clothing, make-up or perfume?
Your first name is a lack of respect and verbal aggression against me.
Get to know others.
What do I have to do with it?
Funny definition of aggression.
Representation of things made by media.
Similary, your negative attitude may be considered violent by others.
So you are constantly assaulted by nuns? What a horrible life.
You are a victim of Don Quixote syndrome. If you don't know what it is, go read books, cultivate yourself and leave me alone.
It is a religion that knows how to adapt to its time.
Islam is a timeless and universal religion.
Medieval religion is like other religions.
If I want to live in the Middle Ages, that's my problem, isn't it?
You know nothing about Islam except what the media says.
It's an original religion.
But cathedrals are also fascinating.
It is not obligatory to wear the veil. You are free to wear it or not.
If you have examples of those around you for whom the person was obliged, advise that person that they can file a complaint.
It is obvious if they are as you say "subjected".
I point out an essentialization and neo-colonialist sexism.
A very strange generalization, apparently you have not met my wife yet.
So you know all veiled women and the context in which they started to put it? I am a researcher. I am interested.
Others are well subject to idiocy.
What do you want, nothing changes in our monasteries!
Just like the police, forced to wear the helmet!
A verbal complement is missing for the grammatical structure .
The veil is not a sign of submission to a man, it is a free choice.
No, they carry it in their soul and in their conscience.
We live in a free country where everyone dresses up as they want.
Who confirmed it? What are your sources?
And why not think that they have free will and can choose alone? #askher # I'MWithHer.
For some it is true but not for everyone. A brilliant idea: ask them?
Subject? Whose? What? Where? In France? In Saudi Arabia? In short, many questions to be answered. Can we talk? #iammuslim #Askme.
There is no compulsion in Islam, the use of the veil is a personal choice of faith, not required by the husband or the family.
Have you asked, at least once, a veiled woman, if she was forced to wear the veil?
We live in a free and laic country where everyone is free to wear the desired clothes and/or religious symbols, including Muslim women.
Veiled women are not subjected. They decided to wear their veils, like you decide what to wear everyday.
Just like you, veiled women are endowed with free will. Wearing the veil or not is a personal decision.
The veil symbolizes being in a prayer and is common to all religions.
The veil is put to approach God and pray.
No Muslim woman is obligated to wear the veil.
Actually it is obligatory for praying, because in front of God you have to be covered.
Who appointed you as spokesperson of the veiled women for speaking in their names?
In Islam women are free like the others.
Do you know all the veiled women to say that?
And you think that by forcing them to remove it, you give them more freedom?
I do not think you speak on behalf of veiled women.
Have you collected their opinion before making such comments?
What is the difference between the Christian or Jewish veil?
On what basis do you claim your assertion of this?
You speak on behalf of women whose rights are being violated, that's fine. What about women who choose to wear it?
Bring your proof.
I wear the veil and nobody forces of the focused, I'm not married and I converted to Islam so non-Muslim family so no pressure.
The beauty of a woman must be protected just as GREAT jewels are protected by alarms. We are protectred by our veils.
The veil is a protection for the woman.
We are subject to our Creator as our veiled sisters-christians.
Do you really know a veiled woman?
There is no reason why a woman should be forced to wear the veil.
Women are not submissive but are free by their choice.
Women do not need you to express the opinion in their place.
Women are free to wear what they want.
It is a pity to see that people are not as respectful of Muslim women in a country that is supposed to defend human rights.
How can you keep that kind of talk while you know nothing of the place of women in Islam!
Women who are naked are subject to the dictate of the society.
Ignorance is the worst disease.
An idea that only leads to hatred.
The scarf is in no way an forced act. We just suffer from prejudice and ignorance. It is in no way an object that hinders freedom. It is good to work outside or travel with friends.
The headscarf is in no way an object of submission and in no way an obligation. It is a thoughtful choice and one that many people have accepted.
The veil is an accessory that allows women to be recognized as a person and not only to be seen by its envelope. This protection is important in view of the sexual scandals that are now emerging with the "pig tone" scales.
Women with faith wear a headscarf out of religious conviction and certainly not subject to anyone except the creator!
A woman who decides to wear the veil to perform a spiritual journey, so she chose to wear it for her own personal reasons!
Why are you talking in their places?
Women can decide whether or not to wear it based on their degree of Faith and resistance to verbal and physical aggression by ignorant people.
Religiously women should wear the veil or headscarf. This is a submission to the rules of Allah and not man.
This is 99% of the time a personal choice.
How is it a submission to hide your attire?
Being half naked is not a submission?
Who makes them do it?
This kind of comment is an over generalization, like many has been provied in history.
Have you asked all veiled women whether they wear it as an obligation.
Please do not generalize, all veiled women are essentially different women.
Why are you shocked by Muslim veil when the veil exists in other religions as well?
Yes but subject to God and not to man.
The veiled woman is free to dispose of her body as she sees fit.
The majority of veiled women chose to wear the veil in full consciousness and in accordance with his religious principles.
The veiled women are not subject to the dictates of fashion and the desire of men.
The veiled women are not subjected, only to their Lord, Creator of all things.
Veiled women are free to cover and not to be a sex object.
Many veiled women are grown and make this choice against the wishes of their husbands or families.
In France, there is no requirement for women to wear a scarf other than personal choice. No submission or obligation, it is a religious practice that allows them to live their faith in peace.
Women of other faiths veil, and no one is treated like being submitted.
Submissive women are rather those who submit to prostitution networks and are sexual objects.
No, it is just a religious practice of personal choice.
It is through religious conviction.
It is a duty in Islam.
They are free to do so.
No, it is a personal choice.
You are intolerant and ignorant.
This is their choice and they are free to wear them.
They are subject to God and they wear the veils freely.
Leave them at peace, they are beautiful, brilliant and above all free to wear the veil, everyone takes care of herself and free to respect laws.
Veiled women in France are persecuted and especially discriminated against because of their veils.
We are talking about the religiosity of women in their places, what is the point?
What about nuns?
Their numbers are growing, thus it should please them .
And what about those who are single?
Étayer votre affirmation.
It is best to ask them.
Submission does not manifest itself in a dress, it would be so easy to find the perpetrators by this principle.
Wearing the veil is a choice for the majority of women.
They do what they want, and you are saying lies and I could drag you to court for defamation.
They are not subject to anyone but God.
They wear the veil because they are free to wear it.
Secularism allows it.
No, this is not the case.
Yes if they want to have things in accordance with their religion.
Yes subject to our creator.
In that case how do you explain that there are veiled women who are entrepreuners? Do you know a lot of submissive entrepreneurs? An entrepreneur, by definition, is independent.
Do you think, maybe, it is possible that she wears the veil because she wants?
Don't you think that there are also women who are forced to wear "sexy clothes" against their will? Or clothes of this or that cut? Or this and that color?
Personally around me, all the women I know who wear the veil, do in their soul and conscience. And you, have you taken the time to discuss respectfully, without preconceptions, with a woman who wears a veil?
If you know what's going on in a woman's head, it may be that you unconsciously take too much from Mel Gibson in the movie "What women want".
They are weak and reducing prejudice.
It is a lack of knowledge of Muslim women.
They are free to wear it or not.
I don't know any women who are veiled out of obligation.
Faith is not imposed.
We should question the women themselves that we almost never questioned.
For the vast majority it is a personal choice.
If they choose so, you can not deny them, human rights guarantee the freedom of worship.
Subject to whom, to what? As any woman, they are free to dress as they please.
On what do you base your statement? I am also against human oppression. Let us ask them what it is all about and act if necessary.
It is an Islamophobic cliché.
It is a lie.
It is an insult to the freedom of conscience of Muslim women.
It is an attempt to manipulate public opinion.
You speak without knowing.
No, I am one of such people and nobody forced me to wear it. That said, unfortunately in some countries with authoritarian regimes women do not have the freedom to choose (Iran or Saudi Arabia), they may be verbalized and are outlawed for having decided to choose for themselves how to dress. Women who choose to veil in France undergo the same type of treatment.
Better be interested in those women who have veil in their mind and not on their heads.
Women in mini skirt are subjects obliged to wear mini skirts.
She is free to dress as she wishes.
We live in a "secular" country.
And a third not for hate.
It is an act of love and obedience to Allah.
It is a choice to keep her modesty private.
The veiled woman like any human being is free to protect her body as she wishes, she does not want to please, let alone seduce to be able to exist, she wants to be at peace with her conscience.
The veiled woman finds shabby, cowardly and dictatorial those who decide in her name that she is submissive and obliged to do so, otherwise they would let her speak out to denounce their lies.
Why are you concerned about her outfit? What does that have to do with you? This is only a piece of cloth for you but more for her; it protects her freedom of conscience.
If you think that after harassing the woman she will become faulted, it is you who does not understand the respect for freedom of conscience.
If you claim to defend them, give them the floor and do not speak for them, do not take them for a lower being who must submit to the thinking of the strongest and see if it is actually submitted and obliged.
Do you have proof of what you say?
Have you discussed it with veiled women to make such statements.
Veiled women do it due to religious conviction and not by compulsion. I have met, moreover, numerous Muslim families in which some women are veiled and others not.
Veiled women are free and wear the headscarf by choice.
Is not the fear of difference that makes you say that?
This is a personal choice, proof: the nuns!
In 50 years I have never met the contrary.
Muslim women are stigmatized.
0 tolerance in France.
You speak without knowing.
Everyone is free to dress as they see fit in a democracy.
Excluding some citizens is a way to subdue citizens.
The veil / headscarf is a personal and free choice.
Muslim women are free to think and act freely.
If there were really soumission from islamic women, oppression and stigma would not be liberating means.
It's a thought of an unreasonable person.
Women are free to wear their veil based on their religious beliefs.
Did you ask them the question or is it a personal reflection?
No. It is a personal choice. Every woman is and should be free to wear the veil or not.
Those people who think about such things are going against the women's freedom.
The man is afraid of what he does not know.
The differences are not a bad thing.
The submission of the woman is these words made by uneducated people.
The veil is freedom for women.
In a free country they are free to wear what they want.
The obligation is religious, but the woman can choose not to wear it: it is her choice and only God will judge her.
The body of a veiled woman is such a treasure that it is hidden in a safe.
An unveiled woman is subject to human eyes, a veiled woman is free of it.
A veiled woman is free from the look of a man.
A veiled woman reflects modesty and that gives it value.
Ask them directly!
They are free to wear or not.
Unveiled women are equally subjected.
Being veiled they are not submitted, they fully live their religion.
It is not an obligation, it is a choice.
You speak on behalf of his women without even having spoken with them, even if only once the vast majority of them make this choice for another form of freedom that you do not understand that you know about the veiled woman? Apart from the myth that the media have shaped to lobotomize you the brain, what is this sudden craze for the pseudo cause of women? Thirty or forty years ago, we did not care about women because they were invisible and couldn't read and write, and now that they have a respondent that they have a 5 year high school diploma, all at once we care about them. Stop the shortcuts between what is happening in Afghanistan and here in France ask them the question! It is because they are free and they are not subject to your ideas in contradiction with reality that it bothers you and then we are in France in 2018 the freedom to dress is part of the values you defend so much.
Are you a veiled woman to say such things.
We must learn before saying anything.
I've never seen a veiled woman invited to a TV set to ask her opinion.
No, because Our Lord does not force anyone to do anything, it is our will.
Like the man, veiled women are subject only to god.
The word veiled women is too often confiscated, the media and politicians are constantly talking to their electorate, they are the first concerned giving their speech.
The veil is a personal choice.
Veiled women are free.
We are supposed to be in a free country, everyone has the right to dress as they please.
The law prohibits requiring the wearing of a veil. If they do not file a complaint, it is because they do so voluntarily.
What harm does it make to you? Do you spend so much energy to defend the right to accommodation for families on the street?
If these women were "subject", would they resist the islamophobic pressure in public places and workplaces?
Coercion is forbidden in religion, according to the Koran. We can assume that it is their own will.
Do you think about wearing the mini skirt or trousers or whether women who wear them have constraints?
This is not a factual statement.
But every human being is free in its practice.
Do not talk / think about the place of Muslims.
Yes but subject to God.
Veil is a religious devotion, like prayers are for all religions.
So, the best solution to get them out of this submission would make them feel guilty in public spaces systematically, to insult them permanently denying their integration and willingness to aspire to a decent life? Funny as a way to inclusiveness, and a way out of someone's submission.
This is making outrageous generalization and we completely forget the fact that many, even most of women, have the choice, and thus they can take the veil away when THEY wish so.
Lazy and hateful way to impersonate a feminist activist while overcoming the fight against the problems that affect, in a more structural and comprehensive manner, all the women, violence, harassment, equal pay, gender bias. Such bourgeois feminism is ethnocentric, totally blind to intersectionality.
An old French colonialist marotte who has always wanted to enjoin veiled women to "free themselves from the oppression" of their families, to better embrace colonial oppression, no doubt? The current mentality about the veil is more or less the same.
You would not dare to say such a thing about Christian nuns, let alone ultra-Orthodox Jews.
Choice.
And your tweet is the demonstration of your islamophobia.
The Islamic veil has no source in political Islam, but can be used for a political purpose.
The demonstration or demonstrations there is one too many and gaps in general knowledge.
And the Catholic veil?
What about the Protestant veil?
Uh What is political Islam? No right to copy and paste Fhaine.
Can I have a list of other types of veils?
There is no "s" for demonstration!
If it did not exist, it would be necessary.
Why do you want to politicize the veil in this way? The veil has been in France for centuries, a bit of history would help you.
The veil is a garment like any other, secularism does not impose any way of dressing, but preaches respect for everyone and protects everyone's freedom in this choice.
Have you ever seen a veiled woman in the National Assembly?
Are we talking about everyone's intentions? What are yours? Personally, I do not intend to establish a 'caliphate' in France, I have other things to do. # JePeuxPasJ'aiPiscine.
What is an Islamic veil? Again, I need a context! Political Islam? What do you mean?
There is no compulsion in Islam, the use of the veil by the woman is a personal choice and of faith, it is not required by the family or by the husband.
Have you asked, at least once, to a veiled woman, if she was forced to wear a veil?
The veil is a personal and religious choice. Personally, I've never seen a hijab campaign.
The veil is a personal choice in response to a religious belief. Why don't we wonder if the nuns are covering themselves for political purposes?
Previously: 'Muslim women wear the veil because they are subjected' Now: 'The Islamic veil is the demonstration of a political Islam'. So Muslim women have no choice. Once again! They make the choice to support a political Islam! Find the mistake.
In the same way that a wedding veil would be the demonstration of a political marriage? A bit serious, don't you think? Your tweet is the demonstration of limited knowledge.
For clarity, I'll reformulate your tweet: the veil is the dress of a Muslim woman who wants to wear it.
It is a religious sign. It has no connection with politic.
To dress a little bit more is normal if your are religious, I don't see the link with politic.
Which party?
Is kippah a demonstration of political jewish?
Why? And is kippah politic?
The veil is not a demonstration of anything, a faith cannot be demonstrated, it is felt.
What party? How to join?
What is political Islam? You have 2 hours .
How is the veil linked to that?
And the Christian veil? Is it an apology for ku kux klan?
Can you define the policy for me?
What about other religions?
Bring your proof.
Not at all, we wear our veils out of conviction, out of love.
It is you who made the veil an Islamophobic and political demonstration.
The veil is an individual freedom.
The veil is part of secularism. That's it.
You see political Islam everywhere.
I'm not surprised to hear it from someone who is obsessed with social networking.
It is mostly a media debate.
It is so in France because they have little difference from each other since the beginning. Historically proven.
The Islamic veil is the best weapon ever worn by a woman today.
The wearing of the Islamic veil is a personal and religious journey - there is nothing political about it. There are no claims behind it.
The Islamic veil has always been worn by women that they consider protection.
No connection between religion and politics. It is a personal journey to his faith quite simply!
How is it wrong to get involved in politics?
Aren't you trying to make a statement of intent?
It is not Islam that has imposed itself in the political spheres but the will of unscrupulous human beings to show this religion and these practitioners with their fingers.
I do not understand this term.
All the women I know wearing headscarves make their lives without asking anyone.
So kippah is a demonstration of political Judaism.
It is political for those who feel attacked by this piece of cloth on one's head.
We have given the veil lots of power, when a woman wears a veil she thinks of God, but we made her a spokesperson of Islam.
Islam is a religion not a political party. The veil is a cloth not a symbol.
If in France the veil is political, what is its demonstration in Egypt?
The term Islamic is an aberration.
The veil is a divine obligation.
The veil is a choice for the woman and a garment of piety that testifies her devotion to the Lord.
The veil protects the woman from perversity.
The veil restores the woman's dignity.
The Christian veil is however not connected with the policy as it is the same motivation.
The veil disturbs because it is visible, what can be said about the wearing of the cross or a yarmulke?
The veil is linked to a religious practice, nothing else.
Maybe in other countries but not in France.
Wearing a veil is just a religious freedom.
These words are to avoid debate.
Easier to attack this choice.
What does politics have to do with it?
Always to politicize your intolerance.
Your arguments are against freedom of worship.
This is part of the Muslim religion to cover themselves with a veil.
As soon as a woman speaks well in public, it is a problem.
Great no matter what.
They want to politicize the veil in order to crush the freedom of speech of veiled women.
All women who wear a veil are considered dangerous in France today.
There is no politics in Islam.
The Islam is not a policy, it is a religion.
The Islam does not promote politics.
What is this so-called politics?
What is it ?
Not at all it is a religious obligation and not a political one.
A belief in Islam is everything.
That is not true. As proof, women of other faiths may wear a veil, among Christian or Jewish women for example.
The Islamic veil, according to Muslim belief, is a religious prescription.
No one is capable of probing the hearts of others. I don't suppose anyone accuses you of being an American secret agent because of the nike cap you wear?
It is just a message to send to men who are too enterprising #mytoo.
It is just a demonstration of one's faith.
And kippah is political Judaism.
The cross is political Christianity.
It is a lack of awareness of Muslim women.
Political Islam in France is for me a pure invention. Muslims have never claimed their singularity and are an integral part of the French landscape.
The Islamic veil is discreet, those who wear it are often discreet, and carry a message of tolerance, appeased.
The Islamic veil is a matter of individual convictions.
The Islamic veil falls within the religious and is not intended to offend people.
Everything is political nowadays, nothing is apolitical and we must make a political commitment. The rule of law encourages us to do so, but the veil itself remains and is only a fabric that covers the hair of the person wearing it.
What is political Islam?
A linguistic creation to manipulate public opinion.
Seriously, it does not hold, Islam is a religion not a political party. Rather, the pseudo-experts of Islam that run repeatedly on television politicize the issue.
The veil of the nun (church) is it political?
Islam is one thing, politics is another.
If Islam were political we would have had veiled women in each government.
Not at all, it is like saying that he who wears a yarmulke is a politician.
These are extremists' words.
False, it is completely a personal act.
Many women suffer in silence from not being able to dress as they wish in France, the land of freedom! They prefer to keep their conscience clear and give up leisure and sports activities they love, where is politics?
I know of no religious party in France, what are we talking about? French women?
What about freedom of conscience? Many women wear berets or hats to go unnoticed while preserving their quiet conscience; where is the demonstration of political Islam?
There are excuses over and over again that allow you to crush those who do not think like you, this is a country of freedom, why deprive Muslim women of their freedom? It is simply racism.
Really? And why can't we find veiled women in politics?
Do you have proof of what you say. Who is the leader of this political Islam?
This is the argument of those who are afraid of difference, afraid of the other.
Islam is a religion without clergy, I doubt that a foreign mastermind imposes women, especially French women, to wear the veil.
Why constantly stigmatize these harmless women (and discreet) that are very active in the social fabric of our cities and neighborhoods.
France is the only country that seeks to exclude women from society.
Do all illiterate nannies and housekeepers play politics? No, of course not, but this one doesn't bother us, they serve!
Women want to play sports, swim, accompany the children to school, study, where is politics here ??
It has nothing to do with politics.
I do not know the definition of political Islam and I wear the scarf.
The lives of Muslim citizens must not be taken hostage under the pretext of creating an ideological concept.
The headscarf / veil is not a political banner.
The veil / scarf is private, politics is public.
Political Islam is a pretext for the opression of Muslim citizens.
Off topic.
The veil is only a demonstration of a person who wants to please God.
No. Not at all. Religion must be independent from politics.
These people are not familiar with what people are saying.
They simply demonstrate modesty.
This is your vision of things, it does not mean that you are right.
This thought is the beginning of the path that leads to racism.
No, these are the right of every person to dress freely.
Unhealthy political recovery.
The Islamic veil is an expression of modesty.
The Islamic veil is not a religious principle.
There is no connection between the veil and politics.
The veil is to protect the woman, honor and a sign of modesty and faith.
The veil is not only Islamic.
More than 1,400 years that Islam exists, so over 1,400 years that Islam is political.
Political Islam ?? Nuns, kippas, wigs - is it political Christianity?? Political Judaism? Strangely enough, we don't ask ourselves that question.
The veil is a personal religious choice. What does it have to do with politics?
Politics? Strangely, when mainstream political parties seek the Muslim electorate, we hear a completely different speech! Politics has nothing to do with it, the only connection that can be made is when a French Muslim is going to vote, but everyone fulfills his civic duty, an atheist, a Christian, or a Buddhist, or a Jew.
False because the veil is not islamic, it is present in all religions.
The veil is not political, but religious, but politicians have made it political to use it as a weapon of war.
False, the veil is simply a sign of modesty.
I've never seen a veiled woman that represents a political movement.
Political badges, are they subject to a ban in public places? No!
Nevertheless, to express one's adherence to an ideology, religion or philosophy in the public sphere is protected by Article 9 of the ECHR.
Dressing at your convenience is a demonstration of a democratic society that respects human rights!
If that were the case, it would be uniform. Now all shapes and colors are present.
Affirmation that seeks to relegate a category of citizens in the public sphere.
Pure Islamophobic ideology.
What does political Islam mean?
Women struggle to not be forced to wear the veil in the countries of the Muslim world which make it compulsory, but they don't deny their belonging to Islam.
This is yet another pretext to avoid addressing the real problems of society, of which the veil is absolutely not a part. With such blindness, shouldn't you be the one to remove your veil?
So what is your point? Islam is a political religion, the veil does not make it violent or hateful.
The thing that bothers you is that Muslims no longer raze the walls and refuse to hide anymore.
The veil is an issue in France because politicians are trying constantly to control it, while stating everywhere that women MUST dress as they wish. Isn't it a paradox?
Nothing to do with it.
Submission to God.
Muslims do not steal your job.
Muslims apply for a job. They do not steal it.
Muslims are workers and they are not thieves.
Muslims are hired by employers. How can they steal jobs?
Their religion prohibits stealing, how can they steal your job?
This speech targets immigrants in general, but to be accepted with a climate of hatred against Muslims, he changed the name of the target. Among the eastern immigrants, for example, there are Christians and Muslims.
In so-called Muslim countries, there are thousands of repatriated non-Muslims working there without hearing this speech.
The employment criterion that counts for any employer is rather the competence for the position to exercise and not the religion.
This comment is so unfounded.
Work must be earned.
Muslims are human and trying to survive like everyone else.
Many housewives have no other choice.
Housewives is a choice and not related to a religion.
Housewife is a whole status.
Housewives are of all religions.
Being a housewife is a noble task and requires a lot of work and little rest.
This is a thesis contradicted by the reality. Muslim women are at home and elsewhere.
Wrong. Useless.
The vocation of Islam is not to force anyone to do anything.
Islam is a beautiful religion of peace, in complete harmony with the values of the republic: freedom, equality and brotherhood.
In Islam it is forbidden to kill or harm the human being!
Islam imposes respect not proselytism everyone is free to practice or not!
Islam does not impose anything to anyone!
It is rather that France has integrated Muslims from the Mediterranean.
What if we were to recommend the same thing for French people abroad?
Muslims are already integrated into France. They drive our buses, educate our children and build the nation.
Muslims are French citizens, like all citizens of other faiths, religion can't call into question the nationality or citizenship guaranteed by the French Republic.
Each Muslim has his place in France as long as he respects the country in which he lives!
Born in France and Musulman, and I don't see why I would leave the country where I grew up!
Forced integration with a desire for assimilation is a dictatorship criterion.
Back? A very relative concept.
The two issues of war/religion must be disconnected.
The golden age of Islam existed.
Western countries have largely contributed to the wars.
Western countries often come to these countries to stir up hatred.
Backward? The woman has had the right to give her political opinion, to enjoy her salary, to divorce since the arrival of Islam. In France, women's right to vote dates from 1945, divorcing by mutual consent from 1792. 1907 women have the right to dispose of their salaries. Other dates?
Your words confirm that you ignore the definition of your words.
War 14_18 war 36_45? We emphasize the courage of Muslims during these wars.
It does not disturb anything.
When will we fight your words?
Your words confirm that you do not know the definition of the words you use.
War 14-18, war 39_45, point out the courage of these Muslims who died for France.
Islam lived in peace for centuries, it is a fact that your hate cannot deny.
Islam is a religion of peace and not of war.
It is hate massages that must be fought. Islam is a religion that invites people to live together and therefore not to fight.
Islam is a religion of peace, love and brotherhood. It has never intended to kill or brutalize people.
Islam does not know war. Islam is the opposite of war. It is only love and peace.
Incitement to Hatred.
Uninhibited Islamophobia.
Propos isamophobes.
Propos isamophobes.
Propos isamophobes.
Islamophobic comments.
Today, the fastest evolving religion in America and Europe is Islam. Is there a war in these regions now?
The armed war is the last resort to defend yourself against an oppressor.
The Koran does not order war at all but peace and a gentle word. Allah says in the Qur'an: "By wisdom and good exhortation, call people to the path of your Lord. Discuss with them in the best way" (Sura 16 years-Nahl, verse 125)
The wars waged by the Prophet were not bloodthirsty. During the 23 years of his prophecy, about 1000 deaths (1.5% of the soldiers) were recorded in 63 fights. The First World War killed 20 million people in just 4 years. The Second World War made 30 million in 6 years. However, it was not Muslims who led them.
No muslim. The majority of Muslims in France are French and Republicans.
So we start with the premise that they all come from a single country.
Which of them?
I am flattered that my city of Essonne is considered a country.
Being Muslim is a spirituality, the spirit is omnipresent.
Our country is France! This is where we were born, this is where we grew up, this is where we pay our taxes and this is where we will die.
What country are you talking about? Where do you want to deport them? In Germany? Or maybe in Drancy? To read to you.
Uh, how do you explain that? In your statement there is a mixture between the concept of citizenship and the concept of religion. Islam is my religion and France is my country. #dealwithit.
Where is the Muslimstan? The nearest embassy?
I am French, I love my France: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. Unfortunately there is not much French spirit left since long ago, they cut off its precious values.
I am French, I have never felt that French as Islam.
You do not know maybe, but Islam is a religion, not a nationality.
I was born in France from French parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. I'm going back to where? In Gaulle?
Ethnic origin and religious affiliation cannot be superimposed, as the same country may have people of different denominations. This is also what makes our sweet France so rich.
Unfortunately, Muslimstan does not exist. Religions/beliefs/philosophies/systems thinking transcend geographic boundaries and admit no limits except those which man attaches himself. Jesus is born in Nazareth. For this reason, Christians and Jews should settle there? Get serious.
Why? Will you be richer or happier?
My place and my world is the planet Earth.
My country is France.
No, I just cannot because I am an Arab outside and a French inside.
Long live France, my beautiful country.
Diversity is an enrichment, do not try to impoverish France!
The Muslimstan does not exist.
To return, I will need a return ticket to France.
I am there.
Ah I didn't know that by becoming a Muslim it was suddenly possible to change your country of birth.
This question should not even be imagined and lived together, what should we do with it?
French of Portuguese origin converted to Islam.
I am in my country.
Our country allows us to live our religion.
We do not need your validation to live our faith, only through tolerance.
We are already in our country.
Speech from someone who doesn't open up to the world.
I have no accountability. I was born in France, grew up in France, educated in France and working in France. So I'm French whether you like it or not.
People forget to tell that our fathers built France, which was destroyed during the second war. What ingratitude.
We are already lol.
Long live the Republic and long live France! Proud to be French Muslim.
Muslims is not a nation. Muslims are found in various countries. And a French Muslim has his rightful place in France in this country, which is his own, in which he lives in peace with all his fellow citizens.
I'm as French as you are.
I am in my country France.
I was born in France. In your opinion in which country should I go?
France is my country. I stay there.
In Brittany?
A Muslim does not have a country of his own! A native French man with another religion can convert to Islam if he wishes: in this case he will go or?
The France is our country.
This implies that I came from a part where I was born here.
I'm home. I'm not going anywhere!
Muslim converts going where?
What is the country of Muslims? The musulmanie?
You confuse Arab with Muslim.
Muslims are not foreigners.
Muslims participate in the development of the country.
Muslims are at home in France.
Muslims are French.
After You, because most of the racists are of European and other origin, very few native French.
What is the Muslim countries? The musulmanie? ?.
I am at home!
If all Muslims left, there would be no economy in France, who would still pay pensions?
I'm certainly more patriotic than you.
But our country is here.
I have a home and I live in France, so I do not understand what you mean?
Thank you for keeping your racist comments to yourself.
We are at home.
Who are you talking to, please?
I'm not French?
I was born in France.
My country is yours too.
To do what?
That's it. They are there! French Muslims are in France.
Muslims do not exist, nor does Buddhism or Christianity. Islam is a religion and not a country. Each country has its own citizens, and often not all citizens have the same religion.
Which one? A religion has no borders, no more than any other belief or thought, whether religious or not.
On the contrary, there is no country called Muslim or Muslimmania does not yet exist.
I am a Muslim. It is my religion. I am French. It is my country 2 different things.
The day the communists return to their country.
It is impossible, the musulmanie is swallowed up long ago, the same time as atlantis, located 2km further north.
Most French Muslims were born in France, how do they actually return home?
If you pay me a plane ticket to Morocco, I go with pleasure. Just before booking the ticket, pass me a call, I would give you my availability. And if you know a good plan to rent a riad, I'm all ears.
This country is defended and built with Muslims.
Should review your history.
Muslims have been around longer than some.
Muslim religion is not a country.
Islam is a religion, not a nationality. You can be French Muslim just like French Jewish or Christian or other.
Islam is an integral part of the history of the nation.
The country where I was born is my own.
My country is France. I contribute fully to its growth and development.
Which country should I return to? I am French. If you know of a country called Islamland or Islmistan, please let me know.
Our religion has no nationality.
You are out of respect for secularism.
I am free to live where I want.
My country is France. Sorry musulmanie does not exist.
We are already in ours dear French country of Muslim confession.
The earth IS God's, not yours.
I can also say foreigner return to your country too.
I am Muslim and French and proud of being here.
Diversity is an asset.
There are French Muslims.
Return where? In France, I 'am already there.
If you mean leave your country, what would you say to our Jewish and Christian citizens?
And why, I'm fine where I am.
Imagine that I am there in my country.
I'm probably more legitimate in my French citizenship status than you are with your hateful.
You are a cynical; so you, return to your country.
After having built it?
My country is France, but I think about it!
About racist!
Trop tard!
Trop tard!
Trop tard!
Muslims are in all countries.
I do not understand the meaning of your words.
I was born in France so I'm already there.
Islam is a religion and not a nationality.
One can be a Muslim and a French.
Your comments are racist and are subject to criminal sanctions.
There are no musulmanie.
The wealth of a country is its mixing if you can't stand it, then return to your country as an intolerant person.
History shows that it is the state that brought many foreign workers of all faiths, you have to accept his inheritance.
My country is France.
With us these also with you.
There is no Muslim country.
Islam is a religion and not a territory.
Do you think that community withdrawal is the solution to peace and living it together?
Who is the most at home, who is rejecting the other by fear or the Muslim who home. The only country of the racist is the person and only him!
I am home.
I was born here so I'm home!
As all the religions, Islam is universal and do not have a specific country.
Non-muslims go back to your country!
I am French. I am Muslim. I'm home.
In your country? Or in musulmanie?
There is a Muslim country ?? Either I'm noob in geography or there is a problem with your proposition.
They do. My neighbor Jean Dupont (a Muslim) went back to Ardèche recently.
There is such a thing as musulmanie, I did not know.
I was born in France and thus converted. Now I go to musulmanie because you want me to invent this country.
We are in our country.
Christians, go to the Vatican. Jews, go to Palestine. Buddhists go to India! Everyone should live his religion where he was born.
And where would French Muslims go? Many are the inhabitants of Reunion Island, Mayotte, the descendants of the inhabitants of the colonies (Maghreb, Black Africa..) who have been Muslims and French for generations.
There is no such thing as Musulmania to emigrate to.
France is not defined by a religion or an ethnic group.  It is the country of all those who recognize themselves in its values ​​of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. Muslims share these values.
We are French.
Leaving France would be a defeat.
But which one? I really do not know which to choose!
My passport and my ID is formal: I'm already there.
If you give us back everything your countries plundered during colonial imperialism, it can be negotiated. But if, on the other hand, you think that Muslims do not deserve to have the standard of living of Europeans, then your life will be unhappy.
Islam is a religion that calls for reasoning.
#islamophobia. Muslims are not a homogeneous mass and misanthropy is not unique to Muslims.
Stop for a moment, you are creating a permanent enemy.
Firstly, you are making yourself essential and secondly, you want to create from scratch a hostile climate to Muslims.
Could you provide us with supporting evidence (questionnaires and methodologies used.)? Sources?
If you continue hating them it can be the case. You should treat people the way that you want to be treated.
Try to change the word 'Muslim', it is repeated twice and it isn't so nice.
Loving one's fellow is one of the mottos of Islam, especially for the foreigners.
Islam means peace, may peace be with you, my brothers and sisters in humanity.
A Muslim is made of all colors.
Muslims recognize all the religions of the book and have to get well with others.
A Muslim is very sociable.
This is wrong. I do not hate you.
Look around you, and if you are honest you will see that this is wrong.
This is false, the majority of Muslims coexist peacefully with non-Muslims.
Bring your proof.
Wrong we know how to live together.
(sorry for this response) L O L.
You're the one who doesn't accept anyone.
More tolerant than us.
False Muslims meet like all their fellow citizens throughout their journey, all come out of people at school at work who are places of socialization. They move away from hateful peoplea nd stigmatization of course. And discrimination can lead them to exclude themselves for fear of confrontation.
False Islam is open to all religions with respect for each other.
Islam is a religion of tolerance.
Fake! Absolutely wrong! Tolerance, respect, wisdom and peace among other things are the values ​​of this religion.
It is wrong. And the texts prove it.
That's completely stupid talk.
Total ignorance of our religion.
Islam is a non-racist religion where everyone is respected regardless of their origin and religion.
Islam promotes respect for God's creation, i.e. all humanity.
Do not listen to fools.
Open to others.
About simplistic.
They lost the head.
And why?
I would probably be far away if that were true.
So far you've shown that it is the other way around.
Why am I here then?
It is ignorance that speaks.
You do not know any Muslim.
This is not true, Muslims have lived in perfect cohesion with it. Other people who had different religions even welcomed Jews at the time were persecuted.
The Muslims hate the actions, not the man.
You don't know Islam or Muslims, apparently.
No, on the contrary Islam promotes the love of his neighbor, a Muslim or not. Simply human.
Fake News.
This is not true about the Muslim religion and the most fraternal of religions for all the world.
This is false Islam and most fraternal of religion for all the world.
Wrong. The school of the republic teaches us tolerance and living together. I had the chance to spend a few years there.
I grew up in a neighborhood with French, Italian, Portuguese, Turkish, Vietnamese,. How could I have hated them? Instead I loved them even more!
Muslims fought 2 wars in France and helped to rebuild France but that's because they hate the French.
Islam is a religion of tolerance and peace.
I am a Muslim and I love you ;-)
The media and the media always.
Media: spreading fear of Muslims.
Quite the contrary.
These statements incite hatred and are punishable by law.
These remarks are racist.
Respect for others is the basis of living together and Islam respects everyone.
Prejudice leads to hate.
Islam is a religion of peace.
So a convert learns to hate his loved ones?
Muslims take as an example a man who respected his uncle who was not a believer and who respected all his commitments to non-Muslim.
These are the wrong images that frighten you.
These are all the opposites.
I invite you to my home and you come away with new knowledge.
The only way to be sure of what you are saying is to meet a Muslim and talk to him about it and it will change your state of hope.
By definition the Muslim love life and the people who compose it.
The fear of the unknown.
Islam advocates tolerance and respect vis-à-vis non-Muslims.
False Islam never rejected anyone, Islam is not only made for Maghreb, Arab, etc. The Muslim religion is for the world.
From where do you get this opinion?
We'll have to open a Koran before speaking in the name of Islam and especially during review your history.
Islam means peace in Arabic. How can a religion with such a name want to discriminate against a part of people who because they are not Muslim must still hate it? One thing the first batch of the Koran that has been identified is "read" it will have to start instead of telling nonsense.
A good Muslim does not hate anyone, he must be generous and respectful of everyone and let everyone have the freedom to make his choices. We must learn about the pillars of this 1vabt belief of making racist shortcuts.
Wrong, try to be around Muslims and you'll see.
Allah requires everyone to love his neighbor.
Rather, they seek to make them understand or accept their religion.
The history of the Jews proves otherwise. These are Muslims who ensured their protection when "Catholics" chased and wanted to exterminate them.
History shows that this is false: Muslims pacts guaranteeing peaceful coexistence (Constitution of Medina, etc.)
For a Muslim who believes or disbelieves whoever wants, Allah alone will decide between them and us. "to me my religion, to you your religion".
That is why millions of them come to live in countries where the majority of the population is not Muslim.
It is wrong. But can you blame a person for hating someone who hates him or her, without any other cause than his religious affiliation?
Wasn't the same thing said about Jews less than a century ago?
Muslims have always lived in peace with non-Muslims.
See the history.
Islam is a religion of peace, love and brotherhood.
Islam is peace, love, tolerance, compliance.
Islam is the source of truth.
Islam is a religion that respects all religions.
Islam preaches living together.
Some Muslim rulers have committed acts of barbarism, but this is the responsibility of the perpetrator alone and not Islam.
Islam is not a barbaric religion. Muslims have ruled the Arab lands for the last 14 centuries. Yet today, statistics tell us that 14 million Arabs are Coptic Christians (for several generations), witnesses that Islam has not been answered with the sword. Muslims ruled India for about a millennium. Today, more than 80% of Indians are non-Muslim, a sign that Islam was not imposed by the sword. The most populated regions in Muslims are the east coast of Africa, Indonesia and Malaysia, while no Muslim armed forces have gone to these regions, which were conquered only by the intellectual sword.
The Prophet set us an example when he took Mecca. While he had finally had the opportunity to take revenge on the men who had committed the worst barbarity (torture, exile, ambargo, murder), he forgave them all.
During the Nazi period, Muslims have voluntarily protected the Jews.
Known anti-semitic acts in history were committed by non-Muslim Europeans.
And Jews are stingy? Stop your clichés.
Go to the mosque, talk to the faithful and you will see that you have a bad idea of Muslims.
Do you differentiate between Arabic and Muslim?
The Islam encourages good behavior towards neighbors, read a little.
Do not confuse Arab and Muslim.
Get out of your cave and especially turn off your TV!
Type imam Boussena and we'll see who the scum is.
Muslim women are subjected to their God and not to their men, so as you are subjected to your laws.
Muslims are subject to a religion, as a person can be in his or her daily life to that democracy or whatever.
Islam is a non-violent religion.
Why is submission disapproved when it is related to religion? In all religions, people submit to their God.
Are there statistics on perpetrators of violent acts against women, that allow us to say that?
Every man has his own traits. Muslim men are millions and you cannot generalize.
False. You can not stereotype everyone in the same category.
Women gained more rights in Islam than in any other religion.
Women are very precious in Islam and they are valued.
"islamophobia" is a crime.
Critics and blasphemy are two different things.
Muslims do not want to ban blasphemy.
Islam is a religion and Muslims citizens are mainly French citizens.
Islam has only learned respect and prohibits violence.
Muslims live in peace with their religion.
Muslims came to our country for various reasons: economic, family reunification.
#islamophobie. Islam as Christianity and Judaism originates from the values of equality, freedom and fraternity.
Your speech is insidious and disgusting.
Your question is the basis of malicious ideas that can break the cohesion of citizens.
I would like to send you to the story of Philippe Grenier, a member of the Doubs in the 19th century.
The republic recognizes only citizens and guarantees the free exercise of cults.
The famous Godwin point.
Quote as silly and unfounded as the one who quotes it.
The values of the Republic has advanced to the point that it can embrace all religions.
Living together depends on everyone's good will and not on politics.
Islam means peace and like the French republic does, it defends identical values, freedom, fraternity, equality.
Everything is compatible.
Yet it has been going very well for a long time, strange your tweet.
What are the incompatibilities? I do not see them.
The majority of Muslims respects the laws of the republic.
The republic is blind. It is not suitable for making a religion compatible.
The republic by definition guarantees freedom of worship.
The Republic teach us liberty, equality, fraternity. No religion comes into conflict with those values.
You'll have to demonstrate it to me.
It all depends on how it is practiced but it is not incompatible if there is respect for each other.
It is perfectly compatible.
It is because of the senseless laws that we Muslim women cannot be involved in the innovation of this country and has saddened me very much.
It is the policies that have made it complicated with laws that have neither head nor tail.
If you try to understand Islam, you will see that it is actually much more compatible and much more free than you thought.
If you stop bludgeoning us all the time, we'd be able to communicate more easily.
Islam is of course compatible with the republic. Most Muslims are completely involved in society in various and varied organizations such as associations of parents of students in neighborhoods where others living together is very important.
Islam respects the republic, which does not impede the freedom to practice its religion!
France does not have to comment on how Muslims practice as long as they respect their country!
Islam promotes freedom, equality and fraternity.
This is the political class supported by the media that make it a problem.
Islam defends the values ​​of humanism and tolerance.
Islam respects the republic.
Should you decide to understand what Islam is.
Secularism, the value of the republic, should be there to guarantee the rights of Muslims.
Freedom, equality, fraternity are the ones. Values of Islam and no longer those of the republic.
Completely wrong.
Many people do not apply them, it does not pose a problem?
What are these values?
Every day islam proves you wrong.
Secular values? On the contrary.
You should not insult me.
The values of the Republic ​​do not conflict with those of Islam. It is wrong.
For what reasons? The secularism of the state guarantees free choice of religion.
What values are you talking about because the values of Islam are fully compatible with the values of the republic.
Freedom equality and brotherhood are also Muslim values.
Islam is the very symbol of a fraternal, united and libertarian society.
Many values ​​of the French republic are those that Islam is attached: liberty, fraternity, equality.
It seems normal fo every republic to introduce a law against Islam out of nowhere.
Yes it is very compatible.
Just because some media and politicians repeat it does not mean that they will eventually make it believe it.
The values ​​of the republic are my values ​​as a Muslim.
A little less racism will be good for everyone.
It is the fear of the unknown that makes you say that.
This is an argument of Islamophobes.
The majority of Muslims are ordinary citizens. Some can be very orthodox as in all religions.
The values ​​of the republics are supposed to advocate living together. When it prevents a veiled woman to accompany children on field trip is simply a disgrace and a humiliation of the veiled and free woman.
Islam is a religion entirely compatible with the values ​​of the Republic. Otherwise France would have 6 million problems.
Hate speech and unfounded judgement!
The media, always the media.
Ask them your questions, they will be happy to discuss the subject!
What do you have of Islam, apart from what the media conveys? Oh yes, couscous!
What republic? We're going straight to a dictatorship!
These statements stigmatize some citizens.
Such statements jeopardize living together.
The Republic respects its citizens and their faith.
Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance.
If it's being intolerant then yes.
That's your opinion and it is far from being a truth.
It is been several centuries that Islam advocatesfreedom, equality, fraternity, well before the republic.
Islam is by definition the universal value.
The republic is Islam for the same purpose, equality, liberty and equality.
Think this is a sign of your ignorance.
It was Islam that first established the rights of women, legal fraternity.
Islam also promotes equality and tolerance towards non-Muslims.
Islam also advocates freedom, equality and fraternity. This is visible in many verses and prophetic words.
We already have the Republic's values. Such as respecting religions of others.
At what level? Do you really know the values of the Republic where Islam starts by knowing the motto! That's all said and done.
Islam advocates universal values of sharing love, respect and tolerance, just as the Republic from there on is full of compatibility, do not talk about themes that you see that you do not master.
Secularism is a religion, did you know that? So make enquiries before saying anything.
I dare to say that the Republic is incompatible with all religions.
In a secular republic, state and religion are separated; everyone has its own domain.
The Republic ended "Catholic France," with secularism. Why would this principle be inoperative with Islam?
The Republic has not always respected its own values: slavery, colonialism, the inferiorization of women. When you point fingers, four fingers point you!
Islam promotes good behavior, justice, respect for others, peace. How is this inconsistent with Liberty, Equality, Fraternity?
Islam is compatible throughout the world except for dictatorial regimes, unjust authoritarian regimes, champions of decadence. Which is not the case of the republic as far as I know.
The Civil Code (written by Napoleon) was inspired by Islamic law.
What are the arguments?!
See its representatives, the values of the Republic are corruption, nepotism, mediocrity, class contempt, manifest deafness to the problems of the population, unfailing support for war criminals who go to the checkout, mandatory secularism for everything that is not Judeo-Christian, systematic repression, permanent infantilisation of the population. I would like to say that Islam is incompatible with these values, but that would be forgetting that the leaders of Muslim countries have almost all the same values.
The Republic has 99 problems, and Islam is not one of them.
No. Discriminatory speech against a religion does.
You mean, this Republic founded around a declaration that guarantees freedom of worship to everyone?
Islam asks us to respect the laws of the republic.
Europe is full of all religions and ethnic groups.
As all the religions, Islam is a universal religion.
Islam has arrived well before Europe, so the connection of Islam with Europe is not correct.
Islam has no geographical location.
Islam is not a religion belonging to the middle east.
This speech is in contradiction with secularism, some European communities have adopted Islam for centuries, while other Christian communities have maintained their religion in the so-called Muslim countries.
Individuals have the freedom to adopt Islam as a religion regardless of their origins.
No religion belongs to Europe.
Millions of Muslims are Europeans.
Islam does not belong to any region as such, it is a religion like any other.
Islamophobia is a crime.
Islamophobia is a disease like any racism.
Freedom of expression is defined by the French laws.
Islamophobia has nothing to do with freedom of expression.
Freedom of expression ends when there is an attack on a religion and a part of the population.
Incitement to hatred.
No assistance to anyone in danger.
#islamophobia. The problems that come first in the daily lives of French people are employment, purchasing power and not communitarianism.
I translate for you: Muslims no longer wish to be discriminated against and scapegoats for all the evils of society, they have no right.
Do you refer to the direct treatment of Muslim populations or perceived as such, the cumulative discrimination, permanent injunctions and daily suspicion? We must stop reversing the prism.
This essentialization and criminalization makes the game of the enemies of democracy.
I can suggest you a book: 'French elite and construction of the Muslim problem' by Julien Beaugé and Abdellali Hajjat.
Change the glasses.
Who says the problem says the solution.
Analysis of the 'we'? Who makes it?
There is no Muslim problem, there are only human problems, Islam is a religion of positivity.
I am sure that you see one, but this does not mean that it exists.
Change the pair of glasses, they are #islamophobic.
There is no Muslim problem in France, there is increasingly a problem with the visibility of Muslims.
This impression is certainly the result of excessive media coverage of Muslims. The subject sells!
For lack of a solution, politicians focus on Muslims.
Why is there a problem?
It becomes too Islamophobic and the media gives it too much echo.
Frankly, we do not have to justify ourselves to haters who do not want to talk to us.
Muslims are not a problem. They seek their place in society and that has inspired them to live in peace but do not wish to live hidden or be assimilated. We are all a part of our society.
Can you tell us what the problem is? Have you personally met such problem?
This is all made up! People will eventually believe it is because of Islam that there's unemployment in France! Pathetic.
Remove the veil that is over your eyes you will see more clearly!
I see more and more uninhibited racism and a fixation on Muslims!
It depends on which glasses you are looking at.
This is because mass propaganda works well.
What type?
The rejection of Islam has become a political pretext to please a French population that has become racist.
Muslims are instead victims of a system that harasses them.
When you stop being aggressive towards Muslims, there will be no problem.
By dint of talking about it, it hurts us.
This is amplified by the news.
The real problem is that you spend your time hating us.
What kind of problem?
If for you, praying and doing good is a problem, then you are the problem.
You see more and more attacks on Muslims as a result of the controversies you orchestrated.
Who are we? What do "we" see exactly?
Can you elaborate your words because the problems you mention are surely economic social problems.
Yes, because our glasses (media) are distorted.
It is the media that focuses on this.
The Muslim population is becoming more and more important demographically, that is a fact. On the other hand, the problem often comes from those who are intolerant of differences and not from Muslims themselves.
This is because you do not have the right frames.
There will be "Muslim problem" as the media speak of Muslims without giving them a voice.
At the day we let Muslims speak for themselves and defend themselves, we will really know them and ensure that there is no Muslim problem.
Do you know the history of Islam and the contribution it has made to science (medicine, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, etc.)?
In 2030 in France 10% of the population in France will be Muslim. That is an overwhelming majority ;-)
I'm speechless about these allegations.
The Muslim is a facilitator and is a part of the solution of living together.
Because you simply stigmatize this community.
Ahh yes. It is true, the media tries somehow to exclude us from all spaces. We are too visible! We still have the streets and social networks.
It is absent in politics!
I agree with you when I'm in Marrakesh, too French! Paranoia is settling in!
Yes indeed, you are becoming paranoid! You watch too much TV!
Yet on television they are non-existent!
Associating some citizens with problems is disrespectful.
These statements stigmatize the citizens of this religion.
I'm not good at math.
France is a country of tolerance and peace.
You need to talk to competent people in the Muslim world and you will realize that there is no problem but ignorance.
As you wish.
This is your vision. I am a Muslim and I have no problem with my religion.
Start by understanding why and you'll be smarter.
No, you create more problems against Muslims.
And that comes from where you think it comes from.
The stigma of a religion has never been a problem for us but rather a problem for you.
Political recovery.
It is the media that feed this fear.
The Muslim problem is powered by some journalists and politicians.
Only in France there is a problem with Muslims. For example in England there is no problem with Muslims.
Muslims are not the Islam. They are trying to practice and believe in a religion that does not have to bear responsibility for everyone, and fools are not religions, Muslims are not problem, but you who have a problem with Muslims in the end.
Politicians have made a problem with Islam that has existed for 1400 years and nobody complained about it.
It is you who create problems and controversies to impose on Muslims.
Muslims just want to live like any French citizens.
Forget us a little bit, thank you.
It is you who are building "the" problem by mounting media shots.
France does not think it is a problem to exploit, belittle or massacre its Muslim colonies.
I rather see a problem of intolerance, racism and xenophobia!
We see only what we look at. Do you not see a social problem, a racist problem, a problem of violence that affect our country?
The concern is historical and it is appropriate that each side is reconciled with its history (Islamic civilization, reconquered, and so on)
What is exactly the problem?
You do well to clarify that YOU SEE.
Do not hesitate to seek medical advice if you see things that do not exist.
Yes, there is a problem with the way we talk about Muslims in this country. Hateful people used to bully them, to belittle them, to insult and to doubt their good faith all the time, and they are almost never punished. This is indeed a problem. I would not have called a Muslim problem, but it is indeed a problem.
If by problem you mean that Muslims are investing a public space that was forbidden to them until a few decades ago, it is not society that has a Muslim problem, it is you who have a hate problem.
Muslims are not violent, if some people get out of hand, it does not particularly mean that all Muslims are violent.
Violence is condemned in Islam.
These are the individuals who are violent.
Also freedom of conscience.
All forms of phobia can be cured, I offer you a cure with Muslims.
Islamophobia is a crime punishable by law.
Islamophobia is a crime against Muslims, punishable by law, it is in no way a duty.
Islamophobia is a crime.
Islamophobia is an incitement to hatred against a religion and a group of people.
Islamophobia is a form of unabashed racism against Islam!
Islamophobia is a crime like any form of racism.
You can be Islamophobic in your inner self but you can't encourage others to do that.
Start with Islamophobia, a real scourge.
Start with the madness you have reached.
Let's start with the Islamophobia scourge.
Also your hate.
When will the fascist antivirus arrive?
Islam is a recognized religion, your hate is the disease. Do not try to contaminate us.
Your hatred is the disease, tolerance is the cure.
Hatred and xenophobia must be fought, nothing else.
Islam is a religion that must be respected like all other religions in France.
Don't worry: Islam is not contagious. On the other hand, misunderstandings certainly are. We must absolutely eradicate them. To do so, do not hesitate to open up to others and get informed by visiting our site. Your health will only improve.
Ignorance is a disease that Islam can eradicate!
Islam is love for those who want to take it.
Islam is a religion of peace.
Islam is a religion that invites dialogue and respect for others.
Islam is a religion that does not proselytize.
Islam is a religion that preaches tolerance.
Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. This has proven its value many times in history when this religion is properly understood and applied, without intervention of the personal interest of humans.
Islam does not have his own country, you say that because you do not know the definition of Islam.
Muslims should live freely as everyone else.
Muslims are free to live where they want, like any human being in this world.
Islam means, submitted to a unique God, how can it exist a land or an own country for them.
Muslims are from the country where you are, in what country should they return?
Can you define concretely, where they could return, and if you want to follow the theory, how to deal with those who have no family bonds with the countries of origin and with the reconverted ones?
It is only a religion.
Muslims are more at home than any citizen.
The term Muslim does not refer to a region of the world.
No, people with Muslim faith are as diverse as everyone else.
No Sir / Madam. Muslims are as diverse as other citizens.
Are they nice? That is sweet, but you know there is a little bit of everything.
Really? Be credible.
All men are alike in their humanity! Be a little serious.
It is the intelligent sentence of the day! Be serious.
Do you have proof?!
Every cult has its own meat. How is it a problem for you to eat hallal meat as long as you have no ban?
We have our own butcher shops.
We do not force anyone to eat hallal.
Where did you read that?
You watch too much bfmtv.
It is necessary to remember the definition of secularism, which gives freedom of conscience and does not restrict it.
The practice of Islam does not prevent us from living together and everyone's belief is secular.
Secularism by definition guarantees the right to practice whatever religion.
France is a secular country, yes. In the name of this secularism, the French state is bound by neutrality with respect to religious freedoms, which are also included in fundamental freedoms. It is secularism that guarantees and protects religious beliefs in France, whatever they are.
On the contrary, the principle of secularism of the French Republic protects every individual who wants to freely practice his confession.
Secularism is precisely the right to live one's religion to the full. It is a private matter.
Secularism is the neutrality of the state towards all religions on an equal footing.
Really? It is contrary to the principles of Muslims to take advantage of a failure!
And the French benefit from the Muslim system: e.g. Family allowance.
False: Muslims take advantage of all systems, that's what a system is for.
Muslims are an integral part of the French system, they do not benefit from it any more than they contribute to it.
Muslims are actively involved in the French economy and are a source of wealth for it.
The citizens of a nation (of any religion) are entitled to enjoy their rights conferred by the taxes collected.
The French system allows people who need support to receive specific benefits or allowances determined by the legislator. The religious criterion is not considered in the allocation of this aid.
Each French, whatever his religion, hass rights and duties, the French system does not benefit only Muslim French.
French Muslims do not take advantage of the system because it is open to all French citizens!
Meaningless statement.
Islam advocates the value of subsistence obtained through the fruit of its labour.
Unfortunately some malicious Muslims enjoy some social benefits. But this is unacceptable. This is not a reason to stigmatize Islam.
This choice is mine.
It is not prohibited by law.
These are our daughters, we have the choice to educate them as we wish.
This is none of your business.
Parental authority exists in France.
Muslims do not impose sharia, they apply European laws in their practice.
Muslims do not impose anything.
#islamophobie. Islam is not a disease. It is not contagious.
Making the game of the division prevents you from moving forward on issues of racism and social problems.
I hope you do not want to proceed like in China.
I invite you to take a look at the history of Indonesia.
Is this a country?
It is a myth that is prevalent in identity settings, don't worry.
It will always be better than 'invaders' or 'yellow jackets'!
What is your number? You have futuristic visions.
Larousse or Robert?
Islam means Peace.
Islam does not invade France. It is the incitement to hatred that maintains this impression. Knowing each other is the way of mutual respect and interpersonal relationships. You will see that Muslims live their faith in peace and respect for the freedoms of others.
Finally we recognize the Muslims in France.
So we need schools, imam's formation without forgetting good mosques.
Cohabitation has been working for centuries and has brought a lot to Europe. You are the one who is trying to create problems.
Islam has been in Europe for centuries, the problem is the extreme right and it has always been.
Do you have statistics on the growth of Islam?
For me not every one of us can live his liver without any problem.
C'est islamophobe comme phrase.
It is an Islamophobic sentence.
Muslims are largely integrated.
Islam is a religion and cannot invade anyone. Islamization is an invented term that makes no sense. The only reason you want to have such comments is because you don't know what they are.
Islam is a religion of peace and love.
It doesn't seem to have reached you yet.
Islam will spread out of love by redemption but not by terror. People will choose the path of truth, benevolence, beneficence.
Great things.
This implies an organized network with a political or even commercial organization, yet Islam is a religion, no one can be forced to join it.
Another myth that is in line with the theory of the great replacement.
The impression of Islamization comes from the over-mediatization of Islam. Today is like putting a spot on Islam when this religion has existed for more than 1500 years and no one was talking about it.
Are you a mind reader? And if not, the psg wins the next game?
It was only during the Crusades and colonizations that peoples forcibly converted people. Islam has always respected the religion of others.
Christians are present all over the world and no one asks questions.
What is the conversion rate to the Muslim religion?
Do you know what the percentage of Muslims in France is?
The jealousy of a beautiful religion.
Fear of Islam.
Always the same words against foreigners.
You have been saying the same thing for 60 years, nothing has been invaded.
We need Muslims who come to power for that, it is far from being the case.
You don't have to invade to emancipate yourself.
Do you have any proof?
That's the fear talking. And some political figures know how to use this fear and increase it. Islam is a religion of peace, nothing will come to invade you except your fears.
No one can force another person to adhere to a religion.
Islam does not invade, proselytism is forbidden whoever chooses Islam out of conviction.
Islam has no colours or race. It is spiritual. It has no borders.
Before the Christianization of France, there may have been a religion of majority, and before that, probably another one, and so on. After Islamization, perhaps France will become Buddhist, that is what simply makes the history of humanity.
Islam is not a disease. It is a religion, and everyone is free to practice it or not.
If tomorrow, all French people converted to Islam out of conviction, what exactly would be the problem? As long as people are in step with their spiritual journey, this should not worry you.
This is impossible because men are free to choose their religion.
There is a general return to faith.
God loves you, that's why.
You maintain the concept of the "clash of civilizations" in order to frighten people.
You want to stir up fear to generate hatred.
No, clearly.
What makes you say that ?
Quote of a man during the takeover of Mecca it is not the walls that he takes by storm this sound the hearts.
Lol because France colonized our countries and took all the wealth, and then she put collaborators for eternity.
Change obsession.
This is the result of listening too much to the media.
Basing our relations on respect for the values of mutual respect, Freedom, Fraternity, Equality! This is what will allow us to live it together in peace, so let us be intelligent.
Islam certainly has a lot of followers, but you are exaggerating a little.
Islam is a religion of peace, fraternity, sharing, empathy, altruism. Everything you seem to be missing.
No one has ever been forced to convert to Islam. That would be known.
Ahhhh, well! Ahhhh it is for this reason that more and more French people are moving abroad! In the sun! Uh, in Muslim countries where it is good to live!
No other country asks such question!
Induce Fear and nothing but fear!
The media! Always the media!
Another stupid thing.
These words remind us of a sad time in history.
These words are stirring and incite fear and hatred.
Incitement to hatred is punishable by law.
Can you provide me with statistical studies on this subject?
What does Islamization mean?
As all the religions, Islam is only about saving our souls.
If this is the result of the understanding of Islam as transmitted by the first Muslims then you could only rejoice.
In France the majority of citizens are against the veil or any other religious sign. This reality must be admitted.
Islam doesn't need you, but you need it for your controversy.
The truth has never frightened the honest man! But you may not be in the end, which would explain this determination.
The purpose of Islam is not to invade you, but to free you.
Would you like a war of confessions? These are the words you're saying.
You are afraid of what you don't know.
The fear of the unknown.
Islam calls to God: it is a proposal and never an obligation!
Islam advocates religious freedom in accordance with the verse "No coercion in matters of religion".
Rather, it is diverted secularism or globalization that destroys the religions and identities of people.
Islam is already long been the first religion in terms of practitioners.
Congratulations you're a philosopher of stupidity.
Islam is like the movie E. T or invaders otherwise JUST STOP NETFLIX from time to time.
We are in France each one chooses the religion he wants. No one to invade anyone, but stupidity and ignorance have invaded your brain.
When you drink booze, it goes back to your brain.
Religious, philosophical or ideological convictions know no borders because they are universal.
Demographer projections do not confirm this fear.
Islam is the majority in Mayotte, very present in Reunion Island. Does that mean that the inhabitants are not doing well?
If Islamization means wanting the best for his neighbor, to return good for evil, to promote good behavior, to fight injustice, what harm is there to that?
10% of the population is far from the great replacement.
Media and politics divide the French.
Highlights the ignorance of people.
While it is well known, Christianity was created at the same time in all the countries of the world where it is the major religion.
So when Europeans militarily invading whole continents, It is a nice sharing culture, a civilizing mission.
Islam is one of the minority religions in this country and it is sustainably so. To believe that there is an extra-terrestrial plot to Islamize France is a pure delusion. A large proportion of French Muslims are of immigrant origin. Parents and grandparents were brought in as cheap and docile labours. It turns out that they were also largely Muslims and attached to their religious practice. And their children and grandchildren are also the vast majority.
Education of children.
#islamophobia. You mix terms like Salafism (religious doctrine), Fundamentalism (positioning in the debate), Islam (abstract), and terrorism (violent action).
Your speech, unfortunately, does not help fight real terrorism.
You mix together definitions and you use words that have no meanings, I can invite you to talk about it to have a precise definition.
I agree that it is our fault if you have a total lack of culture on ISLAM, I invite you to drink a tea with me for some clarifications.
I invite you to unplug your TV and go to a mosque to meet, exchange and learn.
Could you enlighten me on the following definitions: fundamentalist / Islamist and Salafist.
A very refined affirmation, you can do better.
Oh poor, that's what happens after so many years of colonization, the student surpassed the master!
One might say that you have a limited vocabulary
There are too many -ists in your tweet. This is the new language of identity?
So many words describing your lack of personality. Pretty copy and paste all over the place of long-winded pseudo-experts in terrorism.
You forgot jihadist, table tennis players, sprinter, Salakist. In good milk Sheep!
From which university?
And cyclists.
And you are jealous.
Super duper knowledge.
Muslims respect the laws and, conversely from you, they respect others in their diversity.
Do you know other words that end in 'ist' for 5pts?
If you like it. Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything? If it can be, mix more.
Can a Muslim wear that many hats? What does he do the rest of his free time? These Muslims must hold polytechnic degrees!
Can you explain each term to me?
That's what the media want to make people think.
Stop watching BFM TV.
This is Islamophobic delirium.
It is bullshit.
Jihadist, cyclist pianist also lol (Samia Orosmane)
Honestly, this kind of comment does not even deserve an answer.
Terrorists would be very happy if this was the case.
This could be an advertisement from terrorists recruiters.
There are many currents in Islam and many ways of practising your religious knowledge according to your free will. What you say makes no sense. I'm not sure you know what you're talking about.
So many lies and shortcuts.
If this is the case it is wrong.
This person likes the words that end in ists. And rhymes!
I am a Muslim and I am the Sunna of my Prophet Mohammed.
The person who writes these kinds of comments is unable, in his own words, to define what they are using.
What does it mean?
There is a lack of an opportunistic slave driver.
There will be millions of them on earth to help.
This statement is like saying "Germans are all xenophobic anti-Semitic".
Wow, but you're confusing several notions, you're going to have to choose which one qualifies them.
Define each word in the statement.
And for other religions, what do we say?
No other words in ist. Biologist, chemist, it is good for making bombs.
It is nothing.
It is about being uncultured and racist.
Why they all end in -ist?
Prove it!
Meaning of adjectives? (there are so many of them)
Its equivalent in the Christian religion?
So many adjectives that you stack up!
If you can give me the definition of all the words you use, I may listen to your arguments, if you have any.
What do you mean by Salafist Islamists? We must avoid being dumbfounded by the continuous news channels BFM.
Yes. Fundamentalists, Islamists, Salafists. With the true definitions of its words Terrorists and Muslims are opposites to the Koran, you will understand.
I even heard from NKM that they would even be Kouffarists.
Could you define one of these words rigorously?
You're right, and I also noticed that most of them are gas or heating pump operators.
And cyclist too.
You can be "fundamentally" Islamist and Salafist but in the peaceful way.
Pacifist but not wait and see.
No other ist.
Many ists to better support these questionable assertions. The suffix ist has been well selected.
I do not understand this simplistic sequence concerning a world population of 1.5 billion people on Earth, which has never been at the origin of colonial massacres throughout history or the tragedies of the 20th century.
Far from it, quite the contrary, Islam advocates peace and acceptance of the other.
Could you define Islam for me and these three terms that are discussed?
Your answer is too Manichean. We live in a world of nuance. Perhaps there is a tiny part of it that is part of it just as will go to Ireland or the farc in colombia or other African Christian groups are part of it. This is not the hallmark of Islam.
We don't understand anything about your amalgams.
You know nothing about the religion or its practitioners.
I am Muslim and none of these adjectives represents me, so, no.
If that were the case, it would be a big mess in France.
That's the phrases BFM and the FN loves to feed more hatred.
Islam is a religion of balance.
These are free and unjustified attacks that seek to stigmatize a community.
The truth is that the majority of Muslim(s) involved in the social fabric of their neighborhood.
Forgot fundamentalist, racist, Welfare beneficiaries. Do you have any more?
You should read the definition of these terms or should I say read the definitions of these terms as you seem to be in total ignorance.
You have never talked to a Muslim who seemed open you mind?
This kind of talk should be condemned!
Declaration of war!
Poor you! I feel sorry for you!
We could just wait for a next hitler and maybe we too will become victims ?.
Whatever.
This is an incitement to hatred and stigmatizes some French citizens.
This sentence makes no sense.
Define the four terms you just mentioned.
Your statements incite hatred and are punishable under the law.
I do not understand the meaning of your words.
Christians are all fundamentalist terrorists in the pay of the Iraqi people.
You are reducing the richness of this religion to an interpretation rather than questioning if it is only through your media.
I don't know how to answer that question.
Have you already forgotten how the Second World War began? By thoughts such as yours.
The only answer to the beasts is hatred.
The sole purpose of your speech is based on hatred under the guise of Islamophobia.
Do you even know what that means?
You can call us all the names, but the only truth is that racism leads nowhere.
No need to answer.
Muslims are citizens like any other and respecrent the law of the country in which they live according to the verse "O you who believe! Respect your commitments! ".
Oh la la I don't understand much of "ISTS" anymore.
Who exterminated the American Indians? Who exterminated the Jews of Europe? Who exterminated the peoples of Africa? Muslims perhaps.
How to spread hatred and amalgams with 3 letters: Ist.
It is harmful to attack a calm minority who only wants one thing: to integrate into the society.
All the words end in ist, actually.
That's not true, we are Muslims, which means submission to the Lord. The latter is good and commands us to do only good.
It is becoming comical.
Islam advocates peace and love.
You will not have our hate.
Terrorism is contrary to Islam which tolerates only defensive wars and respect civilians.
Islam has existed for 1440 years but the terrorist acts are recent and are rarely attributable to Muslims (nationalist Mafia, etc.)
Answer by the absurd: if they were "all", there would otherwise be more victims since there are nearly 2 billion Muslims in the world!
Answer by the absurd: if they were all, why would they be the most numerous victims of terrorists?
Already what is the definition of those words.
The term Islamism was coined during colonization to designate those who were against the settlers and their policy of inhibiting Islam, especially in the Maghreb.
Terms used to legitimize dictatorial regimes and to justify repression and massacres of peoples as well as shot status as in Egypt.
It is a shame to think like that, because there are so many countries you'll never dare to visit. You are missing out on dozens of opportunities to become smart.
From time to time, opening a history book about something other than Napoleon, Charlemagne or Louis XIV does not hurt. And would also give a better idea of the complexity and richness of the world.
You have forgotten: anthropophagi, Satanists, cryptoanarchists, Bolsheviks, Arab Masons (and yes, you have never heard of it, It is a plot!), anti-Semites, murderers. Let's be specific, please!
You couldn't even define any of these terms clearly, without thinking.
Contribute to the development of our country.
Edward is nice despite his appearance.
Hate speech. No generalizations, please. Terrorism is not linked to any religion or race.
In terms of statistics, it is wrong. You want sources?
And the opposite? Because I'm looking at a history book of the third grade. And it is embarrassing for you.
For a task of the first grade can you give us your encrypted sources?
Ah, are they all the same?
But who really are all this Muslims all over the world?
Emphasize the verb, subject and remove the movable complement, reread the sentence.
About 6 million Muslim citizens in France against a dozen 'terrorist' people allows you to soak everyone in the same bath? Nice thinking!
If a minority of 'Muslims' allows you to say that ALL Muslims are terrorists, then if you have a defective neuron in your brain, we can deduce from your logic that you are completely crazy!
No, NOT ME! Seriously, I have not done anything and most of the people who are 'terrorists' are not Muslims! More seriously, there are studies that say that! Check it out!
Islamophobia is not an opinion, it is a crime.
Islam means peace, it has never advocated violence, but love, let peace be with you, my brothers and sisters in humanity.
This type of statement categorizes an entire population without any basis.
Considering that there would be 6 million Muslims in France, you are implying that there would be 6 million terrorists in France ?! A tip. Do not go out of your home!
The abuse of the mass media seriously affects the capacity for discernment. If the symptoms persist, consult a psychologist. Most likely you became paranoid.
No this is a prejudice born after the attacks.
Fortunately not.
Look at the number of Muslims in the world, I hope not.
Muslims are human beings who believe in God.
What are your references in terrorism? Pay attention, Islamophobia is not a reference.
You are too smart to believe in what you tweet .
You know all the Muslims, that must make the world?
Islam is a religion of peace whether terrorists like it or not.
Bring your sources so that we can explain them to you one by one.
In every religion there are good and bad.
There are extremists in all religions. The essential thing is to remember that God does not want to kill him towards these brothers and sisters in humanity.
It ignores the positive contribution of millions of Muslims.
C'est islamophobe.
C'est islamophobe.
C'est islamophobe.
This is Islamophobic.
It is ignorance that makes you say this sentence.
That's racist.
Amalgam when you have us.
It is such a terrorist religion that more and more people are converting.
Why in hatred for a community that just doesn't ask to be at peace :(.
If we were all terrorists, the world would no longer exist.
It makes no sense to say that Muslims are all terrorists. It is to make an amalgam, Muslims are human beings like any others, you can't put everyone in the same direction. We all have our own particularities, we are not a uniform group, we have different backgrounds, different situations and different aspirations.
The vast majority of Muslims aspire only to live in peace by living in accordance with the precepts of Islam.
In Islam it is strictly forbidden to kill. This would be tantamount to kill all of humanity, which is a very serious sin.
Incitement to hatred terrorism is prohibited because it would have harmed the people who would harm them!
Do you have any statistics?
If the 1.5 billion Muslims were terrorists, we would have known quickly.
All trees are fetid goosefoots.
We deplore the attacks and the resulting terror. We all deplore all violence! We are all aware of the confusion between Muslims and terrorists.
2 billion Muslims in the world.
Those who terrorize do not respect any foundation of Islam.
Then I can say  that "all the Germans are Nazis.".
Caucasian extremists are said to be mentally unstable while the same bazanés are described as terrorists.
The Saudis are exceptions since there is nothing to complain about when it comes to trading with them.
Only Muslim terrorists are publicized by the media.
If they were all terrorists there would be millions of terrorists on earth today! Let's lock them all up!
Muslims are people of peace.
Terrorists are not Muslims.
The terrorists know nothing about Islam.
The terrorists have all served in prison.
Terrorists are all frustrated offenders who are rejected by the Society.
It is a prohibited statement, I complain.
And those who say that are all racist.
Ignorance of the Muslim religion, Islam is a religion of peace.
I never answer that statement because it is a irrational statement. 
Amalgams that can kill.
Unfortunately, this proposal was taken up by the political class.
Stop the slander and rumors.
There are more than a billion Muslims in the world, so if that were the case, we would have seen more terrorist acts.
Terrorism has always existed and it is the work of terrorists, linking it to Muslims shows the will to stigmatize this community and make it responsible for all evils.
A Muslim can be subject to psychological disorders like any human being, so before you put everything back on his religion, see if the person you describe is psychologically stable, if not, then sympathize with his condition and offer him to treat himself.
So many lies and manipulations.
It was non-Muslims who opened the practice of terrorism.
Terrorism is a method contrary to Muslim dogma.
Islam prohibits terrorism.
If that were the case, you wouldn't be here writing me incongruities.
Like any generality, this argument is not a general one.
The amalgam is easy since it starts from a sophism. All terrorists are Muslim (this has yet to be proven). Muslims are all Muslims, so all Muslims are terrorists. This sentence is as true as this sophism: All cats are mortal. Socrates is mortal, so Socrates is a cat.
A single counter-example is enough to prove that not all Muslims are terrorists. However, it is not difficult to find a (and even several) neighbour, friend, colleague or acquaintance who is both Muslim and at the same time "non-terrorist".
It is like saying all priests are pedophiles.
It is wrong to generalize because there would be 1.5 billion terrorists.
Islam is a religion of peace misinterpreted by a tiny minority that does not make all Muslims terrorists.
Just because terrorists claim to be Muslims, does not mean that all Muslims should be put in the same bag. Just as anders brevick claimed to be Christian, we should not consider Christians as terrorists.
What frightens me personally is the ignorance you proudly display in the eyes of the world.
The first victims of terrorists are Muslims. Are you sure?
Islam has existed for more than 1400 years, and I have only heard this statement for a few years, I don't know where I was thinking all that time.
If 1 in 7 people in the world were terrorists, there would no longer be anyone in this world for a long time.
1.5 billion terrorists.
Many solidarity actions are carried out by Muslims.
Only extremists can make his point.
Terrorists are the ones who say the same thing.
Same shortcut as terrorists go.
At present, the only terrorism is state terrorism. I will not mention the great world power that has granted itself the right to life and death on the entire planet or even some rogue murderous colonial oriental states.
Do you have a concrete example, do you know the Muslim population?
I do not support this. If we go back to the beginning of terrorism, the initiators were not Muslims.
We can't say without proof. It has been proven that many attacks attributed to Muslims have in fact been false flag operations.
Did you know that over 90% of global victims of terrorism are Muslim?
Inciting hatred.
Insult and defamation.
Exacerbated Islamophobia.
Endangering the lives of Muslims.
No, studies show that most terrorists are not Muslims (separatists for example).
It is not the Muslims who are bombing Syria, Libya, Mali and so on.
If Muslims were all terrorists, France would be a war zone.
This is what the media want to show when it is totally false.
Stop listening to the media and make your own truth.
Read instead of listening to the media.
You should look more closely at the Muslim religion.
Do you have the right to call all Muslims around you terrorists? Your colleagues at work, your classmates, your neighbour?
Those who know Islam well and practice it (Mr. And Mrs. Everyone) do not make people talk about them on the one hand, and on the other hand they are rarely or never talked about.
Since when has a people or a community been judged through the behaviour of a few misguided people?
I don't have to teach anyone who does not want to know the universally known values of Islam,.
All known terrorists had no Islamic practice until then, their profile is known to everyone!
How many Muslims are there in France and Europe? Do you really think that the life project of these Millions of Muslims is to blow themselves up in the middle of a crowd?
Why in this case do Muslims unanimously condemn all attacks on French and European soil?
Whoever says terrorism says "who sows terror". Have the millions of Muslims in France set our country on fire and blood?
You should try visiting a mosque and chat with an imam. You would be very surprised at the level of tolerance shown by the Muslim.
It is a message of provocation and hatred.
These messages only wake up all the madmen who have nothing left to lose in all the communities, hatred and fear!
The media! The media! The media! They no longer do their job honestly!
Media are responsible for this speech!
And the Germans are all Nazis ???
Whatever.
Islam is a religion of peace.
"muslims" as a homogeneous whole does not exist.
Ignorance leads to hate.
If that were the case, the planet would already have been decimated given the number of Muslims.
A deviant minority does not represent all Muslim believers.
So all the priests are pedophiles and all the Germans are Nazis.
If this would be the case then no Christian, Jew or pagan could have lived in Muslim land during or after the Prophet's time.
Your reflection proves that learning is vital.
I'm not answering that question, because whoever asks it seeks to provoke.
First learn what a Muslim is before judging.
Judged these is easy. Take the time to get to know each other, be smart.
Generality is always wrong.
A Muslim by definition is the opposite of terror.
A shortcut is never the best way to express yourself.
A non-Muslim who commits a massacre is just a fool or a criminal.
Islam condemns terrorism.
Almost all Muslims live in peace with other religions.
Religious terrorism exists in all religions and this remains an infinitely small minority.
With all Muslims as terrorist all the earth would be civil war. So WRONG!
Yes we are more than 1 billion of terrorist! And it is we who create any conflicts!
1.8 billion Muslims in the world. So 1.8 billion terrorists.
There are 8.5 million Muslims in France. If they were terrorized, France has long been a bloodbath.
You're going to have to update your vocabulary or try not to mix it all up with the amalgams. If I'm amused to say that all priests are pedophiles and that Jews like money, I could say I have the same score of IQ as you are 5.
False because Islam is the religion of peace. The majority of Muslims are in Asia and curiously no one talks about it.
Our religion has a lot of followers so we have to destroy it by all means, so we make amalgams.
Those who claim this thus justify their own abuses.
For Muslims, life is sacred. Who kills a man, it is as if he killed all mankind.
Reasoning by contradiction: Muslims are over one billion on earth, more than 4 million in France. If this assertion were true, there would otherwise be more victims!
Without competing as a victim, terrorism causes far more Muslim victims.
A terrorist cannot be a Muslim since only Allah alone decides the end of all life and condemns any self-proclaimed "associate" to hell.
This is a wrong subjective generalization.
What does terrorism mean?
And Christians are all racist slavers (but with a deep human quality)? Jews all dishonest bankers beginning all their sentences with "about my life, the truth"? The Chinese all underpaid workers starting all their sentences with "honorable foreigner"? All the Indians are switchboard operators prostrating themselves in front of cows? You live in a world that doesn't exist, wake up.
And you, brave freedom fighters, risk your life to write this message, in complete disregard of the infinite dangers that lie ahead of you for having only dared to utter such words to those who are already, according to your accomplices, the secret masters of the world.
The last time a leader was so adamant about a minority in his country, he tried to physically exterminate them.
I think tha if that were the case, we would not have the chance to say it.
The peace.
A billion terrorists.
These people have not understood the message of Islam.
Those people who commit these acts are disoriented people.
I dissociate myself from this act as a Muslim.
The message of Islam is peace, but those who practice it have misunderstood the message.
Read for yourself and you will understand the Qur'an.
Gandhi was not assassinated by a Muslim .
Nobody deserves to be discriminated against, regardless of his confession, sex or otherwise. Thank you.
It is not the veil that subjects veiled women but tweets like these.
Muslim women are citizens like the others and they should not be discirminated against under no circumstances!
You are not asked to love Muslim women, but to respect them and not to discriminate against them. Thank you.
Veiled women work as doctors, teachers, researchers, artists.
I remind you that your tweet is an incitement to discrimination condemned by law, thanks if you do the necessary or we will be forced to use all legal means against you.
Quite surprisingly, this claims to know what Muslim women think.
From a presumed behavior you erect a rule that will block them even more?
What about agoraphobic people?
These women respect the law and are not the only ones to have a particular dress (this is the case of others like the Christian sisters, some Jewish women, sighs, youth groups, .). No reason to point fingers or discriminate.
The freedom to express one's religion is a fundamental freedom guaranteed by law and must not give rise to discrimination.
The choice of how to dress is a personal freedom and should not be a source of discrimination.
These women do not break the law and have personal freedom. They are open to society. And there is no reason to block them or to discriminate them.
As long as a person respects the law, he has the right to dress or undress in any way she wants.
#islamophobie. This is the climate of intolerance that pushes veiled women to take refuge at home.
Assuming it was true, you would not see it and it would not be an argument.
Are you their liaison officer?
Can you forward them an article on telecommuting?
Could you give me your data with the sources? Thank you very much.
It is better than a monastery!
They have been confined by the government, bravo the freedom of women.
Veiled women are at home, not because they are locked up, but because the system does everything to remove them from society.
Inquire: the 'Babilou' case, to name just one, was about a veiled assistant director.
Housewives is not a dirty word!
Accept me with my veil.
Do not stop them from working and studying then.
Allow them to work with the veil then.
Veiled women are very active, for example in associations.
Some women work. Others not. Veiled women are women. Some work. Others not.
No, veiled women like all other women need opportunities while respecting their religion.
The veil is not intended to prevent women from working, moreover Islam does not forbid them to have a job.
The veil is not a prison, and does not prevent the woman from doing a professional associative activity, etc. Islam encourages work.
Yes, of course, because no one wants to give them a chance to show their competence. The defenders of Islamophobic secularism have locked him up. Fortunately, the rule always has exceptions, you will discover for yourself what veiled women are capable of doing in our neighbours!
Wrong, we try to block their way to work because we have chosen a letter forbidding the under-mentioned ostentatious signs.
Some veiled mothers stay at home to take care of their children and give them a good education, good values.
Not at all how many veiled women work a lot.
You are the one who locks them up and stigmatizes them so much.
Veiled women are much more active when in your clichés.
Well, listen to someone like me who is in Master's research in Educational Sciences. I'm well locked up ?.
Instead it is much freer than you think.
Muslim woman + educated woman + valuable woman + educated woman = free woman.
Forgive me, the most educated women in the history of this world were Muslim women.
Then find concrete evidence that Muslim women are locked up.
False for the most part they work, if not, it is a choice.
Veiled women only inspire to flourish in the society in which they live. If she does not work, it is because of the difficulty of working, because of the discrimination against her.
The uneducated who wrote this message gives meaningless shortcuts by annealing the woman to an object. How absurd!
Islam invites women to educate themselves and study, contrary to this comment which reflects hatred and rejection of others.
I know an American congresswoman who would not agree with you.
My mother is veiled and a teacher.
Women who wear the headscarf can if they wish to work or if it is necessary, as long as this work does not interfere with the laws of the country.
Women who wear the headscarf are free to come and go, it is rather in France "country of freedom" that forbids them to go to school outings, for example.
Soon they will be working and more visible, whether you like it or not.
If they do not work, it may be because the state forbids them to.
So you think the economy of Saudi Arabia is based only on the work of men?
This veil discriminates them. They have a high unemployment, but whose fault? To the one who discriminates or to the victim?
Another idea from the 1950s that immigration lives on the back of France, where veiled women are represented in all trades (lawyers, doctors, accountants, etc.)
It must be understood that these same women have a brain like the others that they went to school and that they have the same weapons as other women, not to confuse them with immigrants.
The evidence is on the street.
Some veiled women prefer to devote themselves to the education of their children.
They are victims of discrimination in hiring.
Veiled women are often highly educated.
Veiled women work when they want to.
Many removed their veil to work.
It is certain that at this rate, they will be completely rejected, no school outings, no swimming pool, no sports and no job. Whose fault is it?
Removing the law against the veil would allow them to go back to work.
If they stay at La maison for sure, It is a life choice.
No, since you don't want it.
You can't see the difference.
It is their choice if they want.
I work. It is not true.
They were not hiring precisely because they are veiled.
If they can afford not to work or is this the problem?
Many are struggling to find work, precisely because of their sails.
Many work, but you deny it.
So it is no longer a problem for you!
There are even many great business leaders and graduates, to name a few (if you are interested, of course).
You have stats?
This may reflect discrimination in hiring.
It is a generality. Whether they are home or elsewhere, what does this change for you? Some work, others do not, like unveiled women. There is no connection between the two.
False they work when they have the opportunity to do so.
In France yes because of racism.
It is a blatant lack of knowledge of Muslim women.
You have no proof of what you say.
Many companies refuse to hire qualified women for the position precisely because they wear the veil. Maybe we should start with this?
If most women are locked up because of you not their husbands, you stigmatize them every time when they do something you stop them with your racist comments.
It is not what you want (Media / racist)? A force to drive them out of every corner.
You have to make the difference between choosing and locking them up.
They do not lock themselves in the house. They are persecuted on a daily basis, from the simple glance to physical aggression. They cannot even practice the sport of their choice.
They did not choose not to work. They are prevented from working when they graduate, but there is no problem working with her veil when she is in the household.
They are constantly stigmatized, which is why they prefer to remain discreet.
In France, we have a misinterpretation of secularism. In England, go and see the veiled women work in all branches and even in the public service.
Veiled women are strong, hardworking and determined women. Some work, others do not; it is a choice and not something that is imposed on them.
Let them be considered as ordinary citizens and you will see if they would not leave their homes.
You are mistaken as I know many veiled woman who work.
Thanks to you! For some people unfortunately.
These statements stigmatize these citizens.
Everyone is free to choose.
Veiled women are active.
Veiled women are respectable, your words are not.
Is this a survey? Or your thoughts?
And then they do what they want.
Look in England, Canada or African countries you would be surprised to see that they work when they are not prevented from doing so.
If they were locked up, we wouldn't have all these discussions because we wouldn't see so many veils.
Unfortunately, the majority of veiled women are discriminated against and cannot find work.
Have you ever spoken with a woman who wears it? No, that for sure!
It is your speeches that lock up women's freedom with or without a veil.
It is because you do not know women LOL.
Lack of knowledge becomes dangerous in your mind.
Come and meet us and you will see the meaning of the word freedom.
Too much imagination.
Some sectarian cultures advocate women at home: this is not related to Islam.
During the time of Prophet Mohamad, women were active participants in society.
There are many emancipated veiled women who take on responsibilities in associations working for the good.
Veiled women suffer a lot of discrimination, which could lead some of them to lock themselves away.
These are outdated clichés.
Let us not turn the tables. Everything is prohibited for the veiled women.
It is a common misconception. A lot of veiled women have an active life,.
Locked up? Strange, I saw one outside earlier? Oh, yeah, I see it was my dentist.
I send you my resume and you tell me what you think? Be careful, it is a little long!
Get out of your cave.
Come to my college and you won't be disappointed.
That's not true. All the women I work with are veiled and working.
Racist sentence that watches bfmtv over and over again.
Veiled women are free.
It is exactly because it is not true that you have a problem with that!
It is exactly because they want to participate in public life that you make it a problem.
In Europe, only in France are we looking for women wearing a headscarf at university, at work or in the public space.
Even if that were true, how is that damaging you?
If that were true, you wouldn't meet them on the street and in the workplace!
Another theory forwarded by Islamophobic.
The proof ??!
So they steal the work of the French by staying at home! And instead of funding scientific research to understand such power, you are alienating it?
And that is exactly why they must be prohibited from wearing their veils in public spaces. It is complex thinking, don't look for it.
On the contrary, many are working.
It is a choice to work.
Islam does not hate Islamic women. They are an integral part of the society.
On the contrary, there is no religion in which women are worth as much as Islam!
God has ordered us to respect and honor the woman because she is the future!
Islam has raised the Woman. In Islam a woman is a treasure, a crystal that is sacred!
Islam considers women to be jewels. And like any gemstone, it must be protected from unhealthy eyes.
Islam values women in many ways: respect for the mother, the right to inheritance, the right to dispose of one's property without the consent of one's husband, equality with men before God.
The Qur'an liberated women, honored them as a human being. Previously they were part of the furniture, they were sold, bought and some considered them closer to animals or demons. The Qur'an came to rectify this by saying: "We created you from a male and a female, man and woman.
The Qur'an honors some women such as Mary (mother of Jesus) and the wife of Pharaoh.
Your statement, I confess, has puzzled me, especially when you write that they are beasts and not men, is a statement full of violence, how to take a punch in the stomach.
Migrants contribute to the Italian GDP to an extent to pay not only the expenses of hospitality but also many pensions.
The islamic immigrants who work together to other migrants produce 2.4% of GDP.
I noticed that this comment contains so much hatred. Can you please tell me where it comes from?
Those people that we welcome, are persons with their own life, a story often marked by violence suffered, not made.
The criminals are of all populations and all religions, fortunately, a minority, you should never generalize. You are Italian, so you are a mobster?
Violence and terrorism are serious problems, but only who commits them are responsible, not all of them: Italians are not all responsible for the crimes of the Mafia or Camorra.
A small number of asylum seekers is effectively maintained for a short period. This is just to prevent that, lying on the street and in trouble, they'll end up becoming criminals. The bulk of crime made by immigrants is not the work of this category, but of irregulars (which are not maintained by anyone).
We do not support anyone, because most of these people work and provide for its sustenance.
The perception of security often does not reflect reality, it is not true that immigrants commit more murders of Italians.
The hospitality is not always the best, and for some hothead, we can't throw the baby out with the bathwater, because no one is blameless .for example, exploiters of people, gangsters and criminals also of our nationality.
On what basis do you say that?
Unfortunately, no nation is free from individual cases of madness, yet we are all human beings.
They are men and women, just as we are; they are not all murderers, do not generalize.
I understand the concern linked to certain crimes committed by foreign citizens, but generalizing is unfair to all those who want to integrate normally.
The claim is so severe, that it turns the stomach, and there is no justification whatsoever.
Yeah. And the many who die because of illegal hiring or racial hatred or fatigue?
It is not true that we maintain them. Only some asylum seekers (a small group).
Let's stop saying 'them'. Criminals have a name, the rest are common people.
In fact, our organized crime exploit them for the benefit of the GDP and also for his own businesses since it can save on fruits and vegetables due to illegal hiring.
I honestly think that it is better to avoid generalizations: immigration does not mean terrorism.
Terrorism must be condemned without hesitation, but the responsibility is of those who commit an act of terrorism and those who encourage it, not of all.
I find your statement neither acceptable nor true, a large share of economic resources devoted to immigrants comes from Europe.
Crime is certainly not the prerogative of migrants, we are well capable of organizing themselves.
Watch out that the victims is not only us, but all those who are forced to leave their country and to seek shelter and refuge here, also it seems to me that she is enormously generalizing.
How can you say that they kill us? Do you have data to prove it?
It is your address 'Italy'? Did you buy the entire Italian territory?
Oh lately, saying that we welcome them seems an unrealistic claim, even saying that they kill us seems a bit strong and a bit too excessive, don't you think?
Criminals must be punished but not confused with the majority, who lives with us peacefully.
It seems unfair to me to generalize for the crimes committed by the individual. Many foreigners who arrive in our country, needing a least initial help, just want to be integrated without wanting to hurt anyone.
If only we tried to integrate them really, rather than relegate them to the margins of our society, perhaps the phenomena of violence would be limited.
Murder cases do not involve all migrants, who are men like us.
Those that you calls killers are a very small proportion of foreigners arriving in Italy. This small part is no different from other criminals who kill in Italy. You cannot call all Muslims murderers, nor give them the adjective of beasts. They are men like us and if they do something that goes against the law are punished as any criminal, they are not punished for being Muslims.
We give migrants room and board only if they are asylum seekers and roughly only for the duration of the analysis of the request.
I have friends who are refugees and they have rights such as the right to study. They've never killed anyone.
Not all foreigners commit crimes that are so terrible, who does them are only a small percentage of the total number of foreigners.
Hi, your comment reflects disinformation about migrants.
Following your reasoning, we should remove medical care and free education to all Italians, because Italians are those who commit more crimes.
You are really generalizing. Among many good people, there is certainly some criminal, but as always happens. Use terms such undignified only sharpen the hatred, I do not share your language.
Boeri said that immigrants that work in Italy are those who support us and the pensions of our grandparents. We give them the most precarious jobs and a livelihood almost nonexistent, that comes from Europe, not from state coffers.
Good evening, according to the Istat the comparison cost-benefit regard to immigration is positive, then they not only maintain themselves but also support us, paying 5% of total contributions.
Actually,we treat them like beasts if to welcome means to nourish the worst prejudices against them and not allow them to integrate.
So, no one is 'maintaining' the migrants, is part of the temporary shelter project. Migrants are human beings and do not kill anyone.
It's like saying all Italians are mobsters! We must not throw the baby out with the bathwater.
The great majority of immigrants support themselves. Only who apply for asylum is supported waiting for his application to be processed.
Oh lately, saying that we welcome them seems an unrealistic claim.
Do they kill us? Them who? Who are you referring to? It does not seem to me that the killers have a certain ethnic or national belonging, and I have not heard of a massacre of Italians made by certain categories of persons.
The responsibility is individual, not collective. Otherwise, we are all guilty for feminicide, or for crimes committed by Italians in other countries.
Whoever kills must be punished regardless of its origins or religious beliefs.
If we give to these people the chance to work regularly and contribute to the growth of the GDP of this country, rather than relegate them to ghettos or feeding them to the crime, we could solve the problem of integration.
The costs of hospitality are supported by European funds.
Do you know the number of crimes committed by migrants? And those committed by Italians? Crime has no culture or ethnicity, has a social origin.
Good evening, the number of murders falls every year, despite the growth (until 2016) in the number of immigrants arrived in Italy. How do you connect the two data?
They said the same of Jews, Italian immigrants and history have proved them wrong. What part do you choose? In which way you want to be remembered? As someone who has helped those in trouble or as someone who caused the death of innocent people?
We make people study in our schools and they become racists, they are beasts, not men.
Good evening, of who are you talking about specifically?
A civil country must take care of all the people present in the area, as you and I receive education and free medical care, everyone has the right to access them. The crimes committed by migrants are a very low percentage, and murders can be counted on the fingers of one hand.
It does not appear to me that there is a correlation between Islam and crime: it seems to me rather that there is a correlation between poverty and crime, and genocide is not a great solution to this problem .
I do not understand how our welfare 'support' the people. We try to give the possibility of integration to prevent that the exclusion will turn into delinquency, an event that is independent of the original culture.
How do we support them in your opinion? Many funds come from the European Union and cannot be used for anything other than for the hospitality.
How many migrants do you host in your home at the moment? Have you ever talked to one of them?
Let's throw the baby out with the bathwater. The same once was said about southerners.
It is not true that we maintain them. Only a very small number of asylum seekers is welcomed for a short time (at the expense of the state, but without giving them anything except for a couple of euro daily). The vast majority provides independently for themselves.
You cannot generalize the actions of a few (criminals) with the behavior of the majority, which lives with us peacefully.
People who commit offenses are punished by law. Muslims are not all criminals, nor are beasts. They are people like all of us and they can make mistakes. They should not be treated differently just because they follow a different religion.
There are no populations naturally more violent than others.
I wish we continued to receive, we would have far fewer deaths in the sea; in any case, the Italian legislation does not provide any maintenance.
Do you know the figures relating to reception costs for the new arrivals? And those that provide migrants each year to the Italian tax authorities?
An immigrant who commits a crime does not make criminals all his countrymen immigrants like him. Moreover, the crime rate dropped.
Actually now we do not want them, we discriminate them and throw them on the road and, despite all, murder cases made by them are less than ours.
It seems to me that you are generalizing, throwing the baby out from the bathwater. The migrants in Italy think to work and support their families, not certainly to carry out attacks. As the majority of Italians.
First the Italians even in murder?
Fake news or old news covered in putrid and downward rethoric?
Those who have made attacks in Europe in recent years were almost exclusively born and raised here, they didn't come with the boat. If anything, the problem has been caused by our inability to develop detailed and well-functioning integration projects.
Lies out of this world the return! But have you visited the tomato camps, where people die for a small amount of money per day?
Even in Italy, there are cases of murder, and yet we consider ourselves a civilized and evolved people.
But 'they kill us' to whom? But when it happened?What are you telling? Https://www.infodata.ilsole24ore.com/2018/09/04/lemergenza-criminalita-linvasione-dei-immigrazione-quasi-tutti-dati/.
You speak as if it was a cause-effect phenomenon, but it is not so! I see every day people go to work and have all the colors: white, yellow and black. I see refugees in my university, in the workplace, and they never harmed a hair to me.
You talk as if inter-religious dialogue did not exist! There are minds, philosophers, feminist movements by Islamic groups who oppose terror. Do not throw the baby out with the bathwater.
The same Islamic leaders assert that this is not true, rather over time has been given a sexist reading to the Koran that has conveyed certain messages.
It's like saying all Italians corrupt! I suggest you read something about Ahmadiyya Islamic movement, which focuses on the benevolent messages of peace, universal brotherhood and submission to the will of God. In 2016 they gathered in 30 thousand to oakland farm to oppose Islam!
Islam is not isis! Muslims themselves, such as homosexuals, suffer persecution and run away from the oppressors!
The thieves haven't a single country. You should know that!
An opinion based on nothing but hatred and prejudice.
It's convenient to unload the guilts on others when our country navigates in the crime.
Are you sure that you did not see another movie? Like the one that talks about the theft of 49 million .
So they look like our politicians and not only like them.
Arranged marriages with children are no longer accepted by the Muslim community, but in any case these were not consummated even in antiquity until the child did not reach adulthood.
Hi, the Koran contains no instruction on stoning, much less on adultery. Those who commit these acts go against the same religion that they claim to be inspired.
Hello, stoning for adultery is a forced reading of the Koran made by extremists over time, but nowhere in the text there is a reference to this type of punishment. Compare extremists and people who practice their faith peacefully is not correct in my opinion.
Hello, actually the Koran does not include stoning, even for adultery. It is a tribal custom, which was forcibly connected to Islam by extremists. But it is important not to confuse their action with that of the great majority of Muslims, who preach their religion peacefully.
How does Christianity precisely show to be avant-garde?
Italy is a secular country.
On what basis do you define this religion retrograde? Because it professes values ​​such as almsgiving, prayer, love for God, etc.?
Hi, actually Italy is not a Christian country, but laic, which means that every institution and every citizen is independent from religious authorities and religious freedom is a fundamental principle of our legal system.
Hi, Italy is a laic country, not a Christian country and the majority of our population is still largely Christian, since Muslims do not even reach 5% of all Italian citizens.
What solution do you propose? Do not welcome people who risk their lives to escape from hunger and war? I believe that in our country there is plenty of space to practice Islam without having to convert all of us.
Please read the Italian Constitution and you will find that Italy is a secular country, not a Christian country, for this reason all religions are accepted.
Italy is a laic country.
How many fake news, where did you see so many landings of these 'retrograde religious'?
Anyone can practice their religion in Italy, because it is a free and secular country. We cannot stop to welcome people who need help, it would be inhumane.
Islam isn't a retrograde religion. For nearly a thousand years, the heart of technological and philosophical development took place in the Arab countries after the collapse of the Roman Empire, while in Europe we lived in the dark ages. Large part of common opinion over Islam are prejudices.
Hello, saying that Italy is a Christian country is conceptually wrong: Italy is laic, the article 7 of the constitution states this.
Many immigrants as you say that 'land massevly in our country' are of Christian faith.
Italy is a secular country. Everyone has the right to profess their religion. Islam isn't a retrograde religion, please do some research. We welcome them in our country because they really need help.
Italy and Italians are and will be whatever they want to be. Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, atheists .
Hi, since in reality, Italy is a laic and not a Christian country in accordance with the constitution, could you explain better what you mean by retrograde? Are we sure that the interpretation highly debatable of certain people, matches what really affirm their faith?
Italy is, according to our constitution, a lay state. Christianity is the majority religion, and will remain so as long as most people continue to practice it. Our law protects the right of everyone to practice their religion.
I would like to point out that Islam and Isis are different. Islam is a peaceful religion, while Isis is a military and terrorist organization that supports Islamic fundamentalism.
Hi, I would suggest you to do some research about Islam. Islam is a peaceful religion that quite definitely not profess violence.
Hi, actually there are several experts of this religion who explained that those who commit acts of violence does so in violation of the same rules of the Koran, that only provide self-defense in case of a serious attack suffered. Those who commit these crimes, in short, do not know and do not profess the true Muslim faith.
Hi, I do not consider that Islam, as a religion, professes violence. There are, if anything, certainly alleged believers that exploit religious justification to commit terrible acts, but which have nothing to do with true religion.
How can you claim that? I invite you to do researches about the Islamic religion. You will find that it has many features in common with our religion and that professes peace and dialogue and not violence.
Do you really believe in that statement? If yes, can you tell me why?
Hi, I believe that it is fundamental to differentiate between those who commit acts of terrorism in the name of an alleged religious faith and those who profess their religion peacefully, respecting the culture of others.
The interpretation that man gives to religion often disrupts the meaning.
Just as in the Bible there are messages of violence, in the same way some parts of the Koran, taken out of context, are easy to misinterpret.
Hi, do you really believe that those who commit violence in the name of an alleged religious faith, can be considered a true believer? Can we equate people who kill fellow citizens with who live their lives regularly and peacefully?
Exactly where can I find it documented?
From what do you deduce this vision of Islam?
There aren't monotheistic religions that profess violence. Those who practice violence are to be considered extremist regardless of the religion to which he belongs.
This is not true: Islam is an Abrahamic religion like Christianity and Judaism, even though with a different tradition, and does not profess violence.
It is very fashionable the 'atheist religion', within this, I assure you that is often manifested considerable violence.
Islam is not a violent religion, but, like Christianity, is considered by those who practice it, the only true path to safeness. Muslims try to do good by offering their message, that is not a message of violence. Unfortunately, some people allow themselves to be fascinated by extremism, as has happened with Christianity long ago.
Muslims recognize Jesus as a prophet, albeit less important than Muhammad, and recognize his message.
Where did you obtain this statement from? Can you mention the source? If you have a source please check if it is reliable and read it carefully.
I do not think it professes violence. I know very peaceful Islamics and Catholics stopped to crusades.
Respecting their religion and their way of life would definitely be a better idea.
We are in a civilized and secular country in which everyone is free to profess the religion they want. As a Christian has the right to go to church every Sunday, a Muslim must have the right not to eat pork.
Hi, do you really believe that committing such an atrocity can help solve the problem?
Do you really believe in this statement? Why?
Hello, may I ask how it affects her the choice of a Muslim not to eat pork?
Look, I struggle to understand your position. I only read words of hatred and rejection of the other, of the different? Wouldn't it be better to put all human beings in the same boat?
Why is it necessary to make this unreasonable action, when you can communicate and understand why are there certain elements of religion?
You cannot force a person to eat something that does not want to eat. Everyone is free to decide what is better for themselves.
Each person is free and for this motive it's not possible to impose obligations by force. Can you explain me the reason for this statement?
Men are to blame if the prophets are too intrusive, in addition to that there is no lack of chauvinism elements in every religion.
Without exaggeration, it seems to me that there is worse than the prophet . Like the feeling of shame and guilt of those who administer the cult.
What about those who put the crucifix also in the cellar?
Deal with it, because even among non-muslims there are excesses of any kind, for example checking the affective and sexual freedom of women.
Any religion is boring when taken too literally included Catholic and Protestant.
I know that opening churches in the world is not so easy; but the opening of mosques is controlled by us and is not so widespread, have you seen the data? (link).
Open a mosque would employ construction firms and workers. If you knew that would give financial support to live to 20 families for 5 years, it would be otherwise?
Why don't give them the possibility to have their own place of worship?
Why should they open churches in their native country if they can't even go there? I do not see the point.
For members of Islamic communities in Italy and in Europe this is their home.
People who can practice their religion are people who feel respected and therefore they respect and learn to respect people of different religions.
There are no cases of such requests from the Islamic community.
Blow up his believers? If this statement was true, they would already be extinct.
Can you provide me the source from which did you deduce this statement?
Unfortunately Isis and Islam are often confused. The Islamic religion does NOT have anything to do with the violent ideology of 'Isis.
We live absorbed in a religious tradition, which considered legitimate burning at the stake all people suspected of being 'diverted', including scientists such as Galileo, which simply tried to understand the functioning of our universe.
It is a statement that has nothing to do with reality.
The Muslim community is unanimously sided against religious extremism, which is not part of their religion.
Do you really believe in your statement? Did you do some research before writing this comment?
Associating Islam to terrorism means to exploit.
In fact, we share our lives with Islam, a religion that professes love, brotherhood and dedication to God.
Hi, actually several experts of the Koran showed that violence is not accepted in itself, except for cases of self-defence. Those who commit crimes in the name of this religion, in short, are doing it violating the same rules of the faith to which they believe to be inspired.
Hi, I think it is important, however, to differentiate between those who commit atrocious violence in the name of an alleged religious faith and those who profess their faith in a peaceful manner and respect the culture of others. It is not a question of religion, but on how it is interpreted by a few alleged men of faith.
Hi, I do not believe that Islam is inherently violent, indeed: the Koran does not allow violence towards those who believe the same or different religions, except to protect themselves from an attack suffered. We must not confuse religion itself with those who commit violence claiming to be inspired by this.
Fanaticism is manifested not only in Islam but also in Christianity and in sects and cults that born in our society, not necessarily of a religious type.
I invite you to do some research and find out that Islam is a peaceful religion and its believers do not blow themselves up, but they are open to dialogue.
We cannot live with so much ignorance, which drives to support such nonsense.
Terrorism cannot be generalized to the entire religion of Islam or to any other religion. A Muslim believer knows that his religion does not profess violence, but peace.
This is true, in fact, Islam is not an extreme religion, is an Abrahamic religion as Christianity and Judaism. But there is also religious fanaticism that distorts religion and makes it a tool of manipulation.
Islam also believes in the existence of Jesus and other Christian figures, because it believes in communication between peoples, how do you instead have the courage to say certain things?
Integration is the solution. We invest in integration policies.
Generalizing is very dangerous. Perhaps these are people who have a belief different from yours, but the integration and encounter between different cultures is essential nowadays.
Islam is not fanatism, but it is a peaceful religion and willing to dialogue. There is only a small part of the Muslim population which is unfortunately extremist. So, most of the Muslims are peaceful and do not want to kill anyone.
Who are you to support this crazy nonsense? Fantozzi's son?
Islam is a religion, not fanaticism. There is who hides behind it to perform horrific acts, but this does not mean that anyone who professes it is a murderer.
Islam is a religion, fanatics are something else, like all extremists of any religion or ideology. You cannot generalize.
Every religion can become fanaticism if it is radicalized but does not transform the entire original religion into fanaticism.
Thereis a forgiving and an uncompromising Islam, just like Christianity or Judaism.
I have known many Muslims, some of them were even Italian. No one of them has ever tried to kill me because I'm Catholic.
Only the jihad, which means 'holy war', is dangerous. Even Muslims themselves are against jihad.
On what basis do you do these statements? Where are the facts and the data which led you to say that? Should I think that all Italian muslims would kill me because I am Catholic?
Good evening, Islam is a religion and as in any faith there are fanatical believers, not all Muslims are fanatics.
I do not believe that in the Koran is written anything like that. Bible instead is famous for its bloody scenes, so I think we should avoid such dangerous generalizations.
God forgive them, because they don't know what they say. But it is a sign of a profound historical, cultural and human ignorance.
Islam is a religion, and as with all religions, there may be episodes of fundamentalism (Christian history is full of them). This should not lead us to generalize.
Terrorism, in general, has the aim of spreading hatred and fear and you with this comment are just helping them.
Who have you talked to, to draw these conclusions?
How much the statement contains fake elements, is also provable by remembering the splendour of Arab rule in Spain.
This is an ancient belief connected to the Crusades, who want the Muslim to be the enemy of Christians.
Even Christians have gone through phases in which they tried to annihilate opponents and still a handful of enthusiasts, cannot make you judge all of them.
Murder is a grave sin according to Islam. Terrorist attacks are the work of a few radicalized and were condemned by the vast majority of Muslims.
These are statements that are extremists, are you sure that you want to be on their side? What you say has no basis.
Even Christianity has gone through a phase of violence committed in the name of religion, but that does not mean that true Christianity and all Christians were violent.
I remind you that the history of Christianity is full of fanaticism. This does not make all Christians fanatics.
Only people can be fanatical, certainly some of them are, but it's only a small part of believers in this religion, others are not fanatical at all. It is like if you claimed that all Italians are mobsters. We all know that it is not so.
The true Islam does not coincide with the alleged version that those who kill in the name of their religion claim to be inspired by.
The Quran says that the good Muslim can only transmit the principles of Islam, but without using force, if someone follows another religion, he can do it. There is no mention about killing those who do not believe in the same principles.
Fanaticism is a phenomenon that affects all religions (how many fanatic Christians are there, even in Italy!) and even the atheists: many attacks (even in Italy) born from political and not religious reasons.
Where comes the belief that Muslims want to kill all those who do not believe in their god from?
There are extremists but also many people who live peacefully.
Islam is a religion, and the same way as any other religion (including Christianity) risks fanaticism; this does not make all of Muslims fanatic.
Falso.
Falso.
Falso.
Islam is a religion devoted to love for one's fellow, jihad is a minority not related to religion.
Nowhere in the Koran is said to use violence against the infidels.
Every religion has its extremists interpreters, which fortunately do not represent it and they are actually a minority.
Have you read the Koran? Because for me you haven't. Islam is a religion of peace.
The extremists are a few and should be monitored, with all the others you can find a peaceful dimension of coexistence.
The fundamentalists of all religions, want to kill all those who do not believe in their god.
No, it is not true.
The fanatics are a small minority.
It is a hoax. Do not be persuaded by this crap, all the holy books, including the Bible, have very violent passages. The vast majority of believers want to live in peace, do not be swayed by a few violent.
Their god is the same as ours, do you know? Islam recognizes Jesus as a prophet, Muhammad's predecessor.
So we'll go towards a war of all against all, that's what you preach?
There are some Islamic fanatics, just as there are some Christian or Hindu fanatics. We cannot condemn an ​​entire religion for this.
Islam has proven itself much more tolerant of Christianity, whereas Christians imposed conversion in the conquered territories, the Muslims did this thing much more rarely.
It does not result anywhere that Muslims want to convert or kill Italians. Crusades and colonialism with mass murder were atually made by Christians.
The Koran clearly says that Christians and Jews should be respected.
There are also many tolerant Muslims, they are not all fundamentalists.
Good evening, in Italy there are about 1,400,000 Muslims, but I do not think they are all criminals. Actually, the vast majority are an excellent example of great coexistence among people of different religions.
Islamic fanaticism exists, as well as fanaticism exists in all faiths, religious or not. Not all Muslims are fanatics.
Fanaticism exists in all religions.
Muslims are people who believe in Islam, they follow their religion and do not impose anything on anyone. Perhaps you refer to ISIS.
Is fanatics that create divisions so radical. Are statements like these that generate violence and make us less safe, think twice before saying things that are untrue and dangerous.
The existence of some fanatics cannot make us throw the baby out with the bathwater. It would be like saying all Italians are mobsters.
The Koran punishes murder.
Good evening, then all women, men and children of the Muslim faith have the aim to kill us? Where did you read this thesis?
But do you know this religion or a Muslim? Do you know that many Italians are muslim too? And it does not seem to me that they are all lethal terrorists.
The radicalization is a complex problem, does not depend just on the characteristics of the Muslim religion.
Muslims in general do not impose their religion by force. Christians did this thing more often.
Islam is one of the major religions, there is also open dialogue with Christianity. Fanaticism is not exclusive to Islam.
Islam has many faces, just like Christianity. The majority of Muslims live their faith in a way fully compatible with the life of our communities and they do not intend to kill anyone.
Did you know that the major victims of Islamic terrorism are exactly the Muslims?
In the terrorist attacks, people die, without distinction of who they are, regardless of their religion, whether Catholic or Muslim or atheist. Islam is not terrorism.
It seems to me that you throw the baby out with the bathwater. Fanatics and thugs are everywhere, but that's not enough to say that all of them are!
The Islam is tolerance, history teach that to us.
The percentage of people who kill to impose their religion is far too low, minimal to be able to generalize well.
You could say the same of Christianity, just look at the history.
Have you read the Koran? I think that you speak using stereotypes.
Yes. And Mickey Mouse wants to shoot to Pluto! But go and tell this to the Beagle Boys.
Fortunately there are few who have such a fanatical and crazy interpretation of Islam.
Do not confuse the alleged religious who kill in the name of their faith with those who regularly and peacefully practice their religion.
But have you studied Islam?
The Sufis are Islamic, a particularly loving trend and linked to the arts such as music, dance and poetry. Nothing to do with murder.
Islam is very similar to Christianity, and as such it is not exempt from extremists strains, for example, as the anger of the other side of the Channel.
Islam is a peaceful religion, not fanaticism. The Isis is fanaticism, and I would like to point out that the first victims are Muslims.
Perhaps, you will not agree with what I write, but Muslims are like Christians, stratified and differentiated, poor, very poor, rich, educated, uneducated, a mixture of many different people, as in every community after all; communities and societies are not monolithic; where I come from we would say that 'the world is a village'.
Middle Ages, in what sense? How the reception of a different culture takes us back? Racist narrow-mindedness is medieval.
No Muslim intend to impose his own culture to Italians.
There are no correlations between migrants and diseases, the director of the health board 2 of Rome says this. Http://espresso.repubblica.it/inchieste/2018/01/03/news/migranti-e-salute-basta-bufale-ecco-tutto-quello-che-bisogna-sapere-1.316458.
It makes no sense to refer to Muslims as a unique and compact group, there is no 'Islamic' territorial entity.
If we will die of eradicated diseases, the fault will be on who is doing the campaign against the vaccine.
It seems to me an excessive alarmist statement, with no connection to reality.
If I want to make a trip to an Arab country I'm not asked to make any vaccine because there aren't different diseases from ours.
Islam is a religion similar to Christianity, as much open. The extremisms are present in all religions.
Even the Muslims have the right to practice their religion.
Of what diseases do you speak about in particular? I am not aware that there is a study that actually demonstrates this link between foreign citizens and the increase of these alleged diseases.
There is no danger of starving for 18,000 disembarkations a year, don't worry.
Look, the news of the diseases brought by migrants is a fake news. These are wrong preconceptions.
Do you have statistics, which can make us worry, that we do not know?
If you refer to the young men and girls who emigrate from African countries, I would like to remind you that many are Christian. Immigration also does not lead to an increase in diseases.
If we will be able to accept and integrate into our society those who arrive from other countries, there will be an enrichment for everyone.
I know more Italians that are always sick and at home, than Islamists.
We have no news of particular infectious diseases in Islamic countries.
What diseases are you talking about?
Truly, if we come back to the Middle Ages, I would hope to finish in the Islamic world. They are the ones who brought us out of the dark ages. The Islamic world after the Roman Empire and before the Enlightenment was the cradle of humanity, for almost a thousand years.
Good evening, then you confirm me that all countries with an Islamic majority are poor and sites of diseases that are disappeared? Can you link me analysis about it? Thank you.
Excuse me, why should we suffer from hunger because of Muslims? Can you tell me why, please?
In my opinion you attribute to Islam a power which it does not have, the maldistribution of wealth and thus of the access to food and water must be ascribed to the local governments and to the excessive power of the multinationals; it is like saying that we will suffer from hunger and diseases because of Christians or Buddhists or Hindus.
When we were in the Middle Ages, the 'Islamics' as you call them, lived a period of incredible wealth and prosperity, so I think we should let them in.
The Islamists are not suffering from medieval diseases.
For what reason? Can you explain your theory?
While it is well documented that Western colonization brought many diseases among colonized indigenous, there are no proofs of the contrary,that the recent immigration in Italy has brought any disease. Muslims are also two billion, very different from each other in lifestyles and levels of health care.
Among the Muslims, as among Christians, there are persons that are very conservative and others that are very open and share the values ​of mutual respect and defend the rights of all. Islam is not a threat to us, the fanatics of any religion or political belief are instead really a threat.
Prejudices are of the Middle Ages, you cannot generalize, most Muslims are not integralists.
At the moment I am still in credit, I take advantage of the fact that we imported kebab to prevent starvation.
Do you have data related to the incidence of diseases because of the migration? For me, it does not appear so.
It does not appear to me that there are correlations between the Islamic faith and the fact of being affected by a disease.
I'm afraid that you've seen too many doomsday movie.
Diversity should be a resource, not something to fear. From comparison with the other, we can learn a lot.
How they will limit our food and will increase diseases?
The organizations of healthcare have not launched any alarm about the reappearance of eradicated diseases.
The worst diseases are those who eat your soul and do not look if you were born in Sparta or Rome.
Why will we be suffer from hunger? Migrants do not deplete the social base, in which they are inserted.
The principles of the Islamic religion are not incompatible with Western culture.
I eat as usual and I get the usual flu, and you?
The Middle Ages is not represented by professing one religion instead of another, it is rather represented by discriminating on the basis of someone's faith.
The Middle Ages was not so negative as a period, Islam has been a cradle of civilization.
The number of incoming Muslims is too small to make significant changes in our society and healthcare.
I do not think there is anything that can confirm this type of bond. It seems instead an unfounded statement that spread only fear and contempt against categories of persons.
Really? It seems to me that it is a comment a bit excessive.
Could you indicate a source that accepts the link between the presence of Muslim citizens and the diseases that you mentioned?
Tolerance and sharing are typical of Western society. We must ensure that our science acts in favour of all in the world.
I don't know of any case of infectious diseases brought by migrants, from what source did you take this belief?
Excuse me, but if the diseases disappeared how can they return?
Excuse me, but what do you mean? Have you seen the latest figures? Http://www.healthdesk.it/scenari/non-vero-che-portano-malattie-miti-migranti-sfatati-dati.
Look, the only disease that really is eradicated worldwide is smallpox, the others have not been eradicated.
I think it's best to check before making certain statements. I've never heard of Muslims who would have reduced someone to hunger or would have sent illnesses typical of their religious affiliation here in Italy.
It is more likely that who arrive will start to die of pollution.
It seems to me that we are no longer in the Middle Ages. However, this statement against Muslims really brings us back to the time of the Crusades.
There is no connection between Islam, hunger and diseases.
Good evening, what is the connection between Islam and the return of hunger and disease?
Good morning, the Muslim population in Italy does not exceed 5%, How could this represent a threat to Italians?
The presence of Muslims does not implicate in any way an increase of diseases and food problems: there are many Muslims in a lot of developed countries, such as France, Germany and the UK.
There are almost two billion Muslims in the world, in many countries, and they are very different. The most modern and evolved Islamic countries have cultural levels comparable to those of many Western countries. Generalizing is not correct.
I do not believe that people of a particular religious affiliation would be able to cause diseases and reduce us to starvation.
While newspapers tend to look for a link between the presence of foreign citizens and the increase of diseases, I think that we should be more cautious because no research shows this bond.
The percentage of Muslims in Italy is around 3%, which is very low. Even if it would be true that they are culturally backward (and often it is not true) a so reduced number can hardly change the cultural base of a population.
How a peaceful religion could bring back a civilized country in the Middle Ages?
If you think about it, maybe the Middle Ages is never past, have you ever read the book of Vacca, 'the next dark age'?
What diseases are you talking about? And how could people who believe in a religion lead to starvation? It would be like saying that Catholics will reduce us to thirst or cold.
The level of healthcare response of the Islamic people is similar to ours.
I do not understand the correlation between 'suffer from hunger', and religion. I personally know brilliant professionals from many different faiths, including Islam.
But the illnesses have a religious origin? Do we expect their return according to the religion?
Are you quite sure about your statement? Did you inform yourself before writing the comment?
Maybe you have too little trust in the society in which you live. Close contact with different cultures does not necessarily undergo conditioning.
Migration has always led to the evolution of society, so it is more likely that they will make us exit from the Middle Ages.
Numerous studies have shown that there is no link between the increase in the number of foreign citizens and the supposed return of diseases that seemed outdated.
Looking in the mirror is useful if you remove the bandage to discover that there is only one race: the human race regardless of religions and ethnicities.
What do you mean with 'we will suffer from hunger'?
It does not seem to me that we suffer from hunger. However, as long as other people are starving in Africa, goes all well?
Hi, do you think that the comparison with a culture and religion different from ours is not a source of enrichment?
It does not seem to me that they bring particular diseases.
There is no proven correlation between disease and immigration.
Could you show me with precision at what diseases do you refer?
I do not see how belonging to the Muslim religion can somehow bring damage to others or spread diseases.
When you're an immigrant in a country that welcomes you with respect, you're the first to want to demonstrate that you respect the rules that are there, respect is a two-way mutual function.
Many of the current countries with a Muslim majority have been beacons of civilization, just think of the vital contribution made by Arab culture to our development in all sectors, including mathematics, astronomy, literature etc .
Who was Avveroé? Manzoni says this in his romance "The Betrothed'. Avveroé was a sage, philosopher and also worthy exponent of the Islamic world when in the West heretics were burned.
The Middle Ages is perhaps a mental age from which we must emancipate to appreciate humanity without prejudice.
I think it's fair to argue such a statement with data and reliable information. Far away then from clichés completely unfounded.
We will suffer from hunger if the economy collapses, certainly not for a religion.
Even they have vaccines.
And thinking that it is thanks to the medicine and science and the culture, brought to the West by Islam that we left the Middle Ages.
It's up to us to make them participate in the achievements of our society, especially in terms of human rights. Cohabitation is inescapable.
I do not see the link between Islamism and diseases.
I did not know the Islamists were all sick, what disease is this?
In Italy, it is easier to die of measles because of those who do not want the vaccines, instead of dying from tropical diseases.
Regarding diseases, it is a fake news that those arriving in Italy bring new illnesses: every immigrant, as soon as arrives on the Italian territory, undergoes medical prophylaxis.
Muslims have no intention of returning to the Middle Ages: the integralists are a minority.
The hunger is already suffered by a considerable part of humanity, including diseases, so we have to worry about the existent, regardless of ethnic and religions.
I invite you to inform yourself better and you will notice that Muslims are human beings like us. They will not bring us back to the Middle Ages, indeed they will enrich our culture.
Good evening, of what diseases are you talking about? Can you send me the link of medical studies or analyses of the phenomenon that support your theory?
What diseases in particular do you believe that they will transmit?
In the bounds of the law, security and human rights, everyone is free to live their culture and their religion. No one is trying to impose on us Italians a lifestyle that is not ours.
We live in an increasingly open and multicultural world. Everyone must make an effort to try to live together peacefully.
I do not understand from what you can say that Islamics want to force us to adapt to their culture.
I do not think anyone must adapt to the culture of anyone. Rather, I think that everyone should have the right to live as they prefer and profess their faith freely, as long as respecting the life and religions of people.
What makes you think that Muslims want us to adapt to their culture?
I agree that Muslims should adapt to our environment. But we must also talk to them. Only like this we can create a relationship of coexistence and peace.
But it is also true that the respect is given to all and is free!
Personally I'd like to deepen the Islamic culture, as well as others with which we are and will increasingly be in contact. I think it would be helpful to be all less ignorant in the interests of peaceful coexistence.
Everyone can maintain their own culture, but you must also try to understand the others one without discrimination and prejudice based on ignorance.
Muslims can never adapt to our traditions if we do not introduce them through dialogue. In this way, we could also receive information about their traditions.
Coming in contact with the Islamic culture is a unique enrichment opportunity that we should take advantage of.
Have you ever felt obbligated to adapt to the Islamic religion?
Why can't we try to live peacefully each one with their own culture?
I do not see why one or the other have to adapt.
I personally have never met a Muslim who tried to evangelize me. Everyone is free to dress as they like and has the right to have a place to practice their religion. This does not question the freedom of us Italians to maintain our culture.
Hi, could you better explain your statement? In what context do you believe there has been an alleged adaptation of our culture to that of citizens who profess the Muslim faith?
Everyone should be free to express their culture freely.
Hi, in Italy freedom of religion is a fundamental principle: no one has to adapt to a culture, but you must have the right to profess your faith in full freedom and respect for each other I think.
Why cannot we talk to each other? In this way, we introduce them to our culture and us to theirs. It seems like a good compromise.
It is not and cannot be only a matter of adaptation. A culture must be understood and this can only be done with good integration projects. All (Catholic Christians and Buddhists), have to adapt to today's multicultural world.
I invite you to learn more about the Islamic world, you will discover that Muslims are peaceful people and open to dialogue. Unfortunately, there are cases of extremism, but we can fight it using dialogue and cultural exchange.
In today's world we do not need more violence. Do you believe strongly in this statement? Why?
I read in your words a total rejection of Muslims, but I do not understand why: the Muslims are men like many others in the world who believe in a monotheistic religion and practice it, that is far from being devoted to violence or abuse as some of the most violent minorities that maybe you are referring to.
What is your problem with Muslims? They are people who profess a religion of peace.
I read a lot of resentment in your comment. You would welcome more willingly an alien rather than a person exactly like you, but with a different culture?
Hi, what do you mean for Muslims? Do you really consider all on the same level or it wouldn't be better to differentiate between those who profess their faith while respecting the faith of the other and who does not follow the instructions of their own faith?
You aren't ready to try to understand a not very different culture as Muslim, but you would be willing to accept willingly a Martian. Interesting point of view.
Hi, do you really think that we can generalize against all Muslims? Most of them profess their faith in a way that is peaceful and respects cultures and faiths of the other. Do they really deserve to be equated with those who claim to profess a faith and then not follow it?
This statement seems to me inappropriate. Can you explain to me what is the source of so much hatred?
Have you ever met an intolerant Muslim immigrant? Have you ever knew of migrants, and listened to their stories, before you send them back home? Are you sure of what will be the impact of closing the borders on your life? And on all the Italian people working in hospitality?
Animals for what reason?
Hi, I think that even in a delicate time like this it is important not to confuse those who commit acts of violence and the religion itself, which in its instructions does not permit such acts.
In this world we are all men, no one is an animal. Muslims are people like us and should be treated as such.
No one can be considered an animal. Can you explain to me, why do you support this theory?
I do not see animals, we are all human beings, some persons behave very badly, but they remain human beings.
Why do you attribute this adjective to Muslims, who are men like us?
I think that it is very offensive to compare men to animals.
Personally I've always reputed them people just like you and me. If you want you can try to explain your point of view.
Words of wisdom learned on some pseudo-populist notice board?
Criticism based on prejudice and ignorance.
What elements do you have to say it? Like 'Italians are all mobsters.'.
It remembers a bad racist propaganda towards those who did not adhere to Nazism.
Generalizing never brings anything good: the violent are just a fraction of all Muslims.
The skin odor that I think you are referring to should not be a reason for discrimination, we are all human after all.
If we throw bombs and commit violence it's impossible to reach a final and peaceful solution, only new conflicts will be generated.
Your words are full of hatred and violence, don't you think it is dangerous for humans beings to keep putting us against each other for some contrasting positions when there would be a thousand reasons to live in brotherhood?
Perhaps to wish death at people is not the right approach to use.
It would be better to listen less to hatred and more to rationality.
History has taught us that violence brings nothing but more violence, why do we have to make a similar action?
Why instead of bombs it's not possible to establish a peaceful dialogue and seek the coexistence?
I perceive from your words a profound sense of rejection of these people that are nothing but people like us who professes a monotheistic religion devoted to love and brotherhood. The violent are just a small part.
Hi, do you really believe that the solution to the problem is to bomb other people?
I do not think you have to generalize the fact of extremism to the entire Islamic population. Is a mistake that many people make. Not all Muslims are terrorists. You have to talk to them, not to kill them.
You cannot think that the entire Muslim population dies. Why would you do something so horrible?
Could you please explain your theory on this subject? How can you make such an act?
For all who are you referring to? Your statement is very general.
Why? Can you explain?
Why it's not possible to find a way that leads to tolerance? Is it necessarly to make such an act on those who you do not know?
I do not understand your theory, why would it be necessary to make such an atrocity?
Your answer seems dictated more by hatred than by rationality.
I notice great fear in your words, but I think it is unjustified.
History is a bad teacher. Our job is not to repeat the mistakes that have been made previously. So why we must still perform these atrocities?
Hi, I read a lot of anger in this comment, could you explain it better to me?
Hi, could you explain better what you mean?
The coexistence and knowledge of Islamic culture can only enrich us and make us less ignorant, not leading to a historical recurrence.
There is a solution to violence, that is the dialogue. We must try to communicate with people who have different cultures, not isolate ourselves.
Hi, do you really believe that a peaceful community, whose religion is based on love and brotherhood will lead to a historic recurrence?
It seems to me there is a lot of violence in your comment, can you do me the courtesy to explain the source of your hatred?
Ignorance leads to violence, you cannot attack anybody, not really knowing its traditions. If we allow ourselves to be guided by prejudices, we will always be wrong.
A person who believes in a peaceful religion based on love, brotherhood and dedication to God in your opinion deserves to die for it?
Could you tell me where does this deep hatred against Muslims come from ?
I suggest you to do a research about Islam. You will notice that it is a religion that has a lot in common with ours. It is monotheistic and has many prophets who also belong to Christianity.
Today is widespread hostility against the Islamic religion, your words are the proof. In fact the Islamists are nothing more than people who follow and believe in a monotheistic religion that has at its base the love of God and the brotherhood, nothing less than the Christian religion.
Why should a person like all of us die? A man has the right to life, and Italy is a free country.
Do you really think that an ordinary and innocent person like us should suffer violence? Why?
Hi, maybe you should inquire about the fact that Islam has nothing to do with isis which is fanaticism and extremism. So I see no reason to wish death to a person whose only 'crime' is to believe in a peaceful religion.
Why we shouldn't welcome people fleeing from suffering? Italy is a free country and is a right of every man to get political asylum.
There is an alternative to war, that is dialogue. If you do not learn to dialogue you can never achieve peace and cohesion.
Why should we make a war when we could be open for dialogue?
Your position is clearly the result of insecurity against these people who have nothing less of us. They are human beings with a different religion and habits, but nothing less than us. We are all human beings!
It seems to me there is a lot of hate in your comment, where did it come from?
I would not call them troglodytes. Think that Arabs are the founders of algebra, chemistry and modern medicine.
The war has brought nothing but despair, so why do you say this?
Are you saying that you want to fight against women, children and men who are fleeing their country, leaving everything they have in the hope of a better life?
No religion was born for war. Violent are just a small tiny part that has nothing to do with the Islamic religion like Christianity is a monotheistic religion that is based on the love of God and the brotherhood.
It burns you up some business went sideways on a journey or had you studied at the 'Bar Sport'?
The beasts are able to accommodate their own kind in their communities, if you were at least bestial, you probably would have a greater ability to live together.
No one can be considered a beast, we are all equal and we are men.
Why do you define them like that? Explain better.
The main victims of the terrorist attacks are Muslims.
Why do you qualifies them as beasts?
How many beasts have Old Mcdonald? Ia-ia-oh.
Hi, I think that even in such a sensitive time is important not to confuse terrible acts of violence with religion itself, which does not provide in any of its provisions such acts.
Surely we are all part of the animal kingdom, and like all animals, we get sick, in body, mind, and we make deplorable actions.
Are you comparing men to the beasts only because they have a different culture from you?
I notice deep anger against Muslims. Where does it come from?
Why do you consider Muslims like beasts? Did they do something wrong? If you take into consideration the crimes committed by Muslims, why do you distinguish the Muslim criminals from the non-Muslim? They are all criminals and all of them are punished.
Hi, it seems fundamental to me to differentiate between those who commit heinous crimes in the name of an alleged religious faith and those who profess their faith in a peaceful manner and respectful of other cultures, which happens in most cases.
Why recur to the atomic bomb when you can co-exist? We do not have to immediately attack the ones that we do not know, instead, we should try to understand them and in the process trying to assimilate new knowledge.
Certainly terrorism is a phenomenon that can and should worry, but it is kept under control and it is very unlikely that we will come to these levels.
Not all Muslims are potential terrorists, Islam and democracy can get along very well.
The explosion of an atomic bomb would lead to catastrophic consequences that would affect everyone. So why should we throw it? And especially why punish a population-based only on prejudices? Wouldn't be better to first talk and understand really who is a certain type of person?
The Islamists are not all dangerous, indeed: the violent represent only a small part of a religion that makes the love of God and the brotherhood of man its fundamental basis.
I suggest you to see what the atomic bomb have made on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Do you really want this to happen again?
Maybe it's the right time to begin to pray!
Can you tell me about an incident in which you found yourself living an attempt of conversion?
Currently returns consist of delivering to the migrant an expulsion paper that orders him to leave the country on their own. Of course, nobody does it. This is because we do not have the resources to send them away, so at the moment returns do not seem to be the solution to the migration phenomenon.
No Arab has expected to impose its decisions on Italians but they simply ask that the Islamic community is allowed to practice their religion and to live according to their own culture.
Assuming that no Arab religion, Italian, Spanish, Australian, etc. Exist. And then all religions have their own share of witness and spread of the word. Especially Jehovah's Witnesses and Christians, but I've never heard of Muslims if you are referring to they, who sought to impose their religion even with force.
No Arab has ever tried to impose their religion to an Italian.
We must send home (perhaps not on the boats) who violates the law: this according to the Italian constitution, which provides rights also for foreigners.
Did you know that there are so many Italian Muslims and many Arabs who are not? Arab nationality does not identify with any religion as the Italian nationality decrees not all Italians as Catholics. If you are referring to the Muslim religion I do not believe there is any Muslim who seek to impose his own faith.
To me no Arab has ever imposed anything. Next week I will see my friend Amsa, who is senegalese, to exchange Christmas greetings.
I think it's better to learn to live together instead. Sending them home without reason is equivalent to rejecting them and the rejection generates resentment.
I believe that many Arabs were instead damaged in the history by Europeans that they would have sent back to their homeland on rafts and dinghies.
History teaches that Christians wanted to impose their religion at the home of others.
To profess and practice their religion is not 'impose' but to exercise, it's an inalienable right.
It is absolutely untrue that they want to impose their religion, there is no such case. They only ask to be able to respect their religion (and that it is respected), even here in Italy.
I live in a city absolutely multiethnic and does not seem to me that nothing alarming happens.
You can quote me some cases where an Arab tried to impose his religion in Italy?
Personally, no one has ever imposed his religion on me and the only person who commands in my house is my mother . Send her away on a boat seems to me not very nice.
The Muslim religion is not to be feared because it is different from ours. We have to work for integration.
But really? Some Arabs approached you and tried to impose his religion? In what way would they be commanding?
It seems to me that it was us, Westerners, to colonize and to impose our domination of the planet, even this day.
It seems to me a fear not supported by any data.
Your statement is very strong, based on what do you think that the Arabs want to impose their religion and command at our home? I do not see many Arabs in Italy and I do not even see actions in this direction, but perhaps I was not careful enough, if you helped me with some data I would be grateful.
Forgive me, but the second part of your statement made me smile, why do you want to send they home on boats, if I may ask?
I am not aware that the Arab citizens (which by the way are also Christians) arrive in our country to control and impose their laws: many practice their religion in full compliance with those of others.
The only ones who have proposed me their religion were Jehovah's Witnesses, I said no thanks and they went away. I never experienced 'constraints.'.
There are plenty of examples of Arab people from the second generation, in accordance with their traditions of origin, they are perfectly integrated in Italy.
If we learnt to put ourselves in another's shoes, we would live in a better world without negative prejudices.
The Arabs do not want to impose their religion. Did you see any Muslim in Italy trying to impose his religion on anyone? If so, where? Explain his theory. The boats are controlled by human traffickers, so you would like that trafficking of human beings was used to bring them back to their homeland?
In what way they want to impose their religion? We are rather seeking to impose ours, not having any rights.
Saying 'Arabs' is a generalization and does not indicate a religion.
The integration while respecting the traditions of all is the solution in many cases it is already happening.
Many of them have no home anymore.
Statistics say that Italy is last in the list of countries that welcome migrants and refugees with only 2.4 people per 1,000 inhabitants. Insert links, for example https://www.internazionale.it/reportage/annalisa-camilli/2018/06/18/immigrazione-luoghi-comuni-italia.
In a civilized country there is the coexistence of different religions, none dominates the other, but rather coexist peacefully.
There are definitely people less tolerant toward other religions, like in Christianity, after all; but Islam isn't an intolerant religion.
According to the law, irregular immigrants can be repatriated, regardless of ethnicity (in this case, however, not on the boats, clearly). By what principle of law it should be repatriated an Arab with a valid permit?
I am not aware that Muslims (which is different from the Arabs since some are Christians) seek to impose their rules on us.
The Quran explicitly says that the principles of Islam can only be transmitted without using force. So I guess you are mentioning the extremist forms of Islam, which are a minority compared to the whole of religion. We cannot send back migrants because this action would go against our Constitution, which says that you must receive asylum seekers if in their countries the conditions are such as dangerous to endanger them.
Why? Have you bought the Italian territory? And all the resources that we steal to their territories?
1. No 'Arab' (very general term), has never wanted to impose their religion 2. Are you suggesting to give money to the traffickers of human beings?
Saying that the Arabs want to impose their religion is wrong also as a concept: not all Arabs are Muslims, some are Christians like many Italians.
I do not think that there have been cases of Arabs who have attempted to fill positions of some power in Italy. So why do you say that they want to control us?
Italy is our home and of all those who seek to escape death and misery, as well as the law, common sense and civil charity want.
For Muslims, unlike us, religion matters, and they want to be able to practice it at appropriate places, without taking anything away from anyone.
Not all who 'come with the boat' are Arabs, there are also Christians and agnostics, to all of them would be enough to practice their religion as well as the law allows.
Good evening, given that not all Arabs are of the Islamic faith. In any case, how are they trying to impose their religion?
Excuse me, but to send them back with the boats would be necessary the traffickers, it is perhaps not the best idea.
It is not true, but even if it was true, I am not aware that all Italian criminals have been deported in the past. I remind you that we have exported the mafia all over the world, huh.
Although some newspapers represent a reality like this, there is no evidence that Arab citizens want to impose their religion.
First of all, among those who come from Arab countries, there might be Christians. Secondly, it does not seem to me that there has been a particular 'Islamization' of our society in recent years.
The migrants are fleeing from situations where it was impossible to continue to live, they are leaving everything to board themselves on boats with absent safety standards in hope of finding a country where they can live in peace. I do not think that their purpose is to control and impose their religion.
The fundamentalism want to impose their own religions, and we have fundamentalism not just from Islamic but also Catholic, Jewish etc.
The home of humanity is the world for those who have not yet understood that it is becoming smaller and polluted every day.
Apart from the fact that they are not Arab but African or Asian, I do not see command attempts in our country. We are the ones going to their country to command.
Christians and Muslims have always tried to spread their religion, but today they do not impose it by force. Also in the past, Muslims have done this, even if less often than Christians. Keep in mind that in countries such as Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Islamics for almost 1400 years, there are still important Christian minorities today.
In Italy everyone is free to practice their religion, also muslims.
They do not seem to do all this to me. We must work to find common agreement.
Serial sowers of hate and lies could also end up on boats one day.
Has anyone ever tried to convert you? Me nobody.
We can also say that all believers want to impose their religion. Does it tells you nothing the matter, 'the crucifix in schools'?
It does not appear anywhere that an Arab is trying to command in our country unless the members of the government have Arab ancestors, which is very likely given that we Italians are one of the most mixed peoples in the world.
All religions speak of acceptance and love, the Bible as the Koran. Some possessed, on the one hand and on the other, cannot obstruct a quiet life among humans.
The pillars of Islam does not preach the imposition of religion, indeed they preach co-existence of religions and tolerance. The majority of Muslim foreigners arrive in Italy, because they fled from the country of origin for war and/or persecution conditions. It would be cruel to send them back there.
Those who arrive in boats run away from famine, war, violence, moreover, often the situation at their home is also caused by us.
Send home people who came to our country to try to change their life in better, running away from wars, despair and poverty, would be the same as sending you home if your house was unsafe after an earthquake or was on fire.
What does it mean to you to 'impose' their religion? Until proven otherwise, I have never seen Islam being taught in schools as is done with Catholicism.
The problem lies in having a more open, secular and human mentality without blinders.
On the same boat is a saying that should unite and remember that luck is a fickle thing.
I am convinced that, except for a few bad apples, even they want to live together peacefully.
Good evening, in what sense control at our home? Creating a party and presenting at the election? With a coup? Where do I find information about it?
An answer like that so indiscriminate seems not a solution to me to migration; people that arrive in Italy are not here to 'conquer' us, they come to try to have a better future.
According to what do you state that Arabs want to command in Italy?
Good evening, send them back home for what accomplished crime? Freely practice their religion?
Sending back at home on boats, apart from being contrary to law, means feeding the smugglers trafficking that you would like to fight.
Based on what you say that the Arabs want to command at our house?
To me it does not seem that my friends that wear veils are offended whene they see other people without it, they got the license, they go out on their own and travel. Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water.
The Arabs that are in Italy want a better working and living conditions of those in their country. Certainly, they do not aim to command at our house.
I think they want to keep their customs and I understand it, I would not say that they want to impose their customs on us.
Why? Did someone ever come to you with the aim of converting you?
Do you know that the religion that has proselytized most of all in the world, since the time of its foundation was Christianity?
No one wants to impose anything on anyone. Arabs living in Italy want to live in peace, respecting the law and all citizens, but why do you have this huge desire to find an enemy?
I do not feel controlled by anyone. What about you?
Those who run away from war and hunger does not impose anything on anyone, they do not have the forces to control anything.
If you really want to send them back, it costs less a plane ticket than a trip on the boat. Do you know that only the wealthiest can come to Italy, many of whom are graduated from university? Try to imagine if the same treatment was reserved for our 'brain-drain' abroad.
Being devoted to a religion does not mean proselytizing.
Where do you see all this? Frankly, I do not find feedback to your statements.
But if they barely manage to reach the Italian coast without dying, how do you believe that they can impose on an entire nation?
All religions want to spread their beliefs, but no one ever does it with compulsion.
That's why Koran is taught in school!
But Salvini had not said that he would have repatriated them all with planes? Now we're back to the boats, don't you see that you racists can't be consistent?
Not all Muslims want to impose their beliefs. Generalization is never good!
Islam does not impose the veil, it is always linked to the choice of women, as well as becoming a nun or priest or remain virgin until marriage.
I almost would like it. As a woman, I can say: a great saving on cosmetic products.
Italy has a laic constitution. The hypothesis of imposition of the veil seems to me a provocation.
Given the low number of who profess the Islamic faith in Italy, I doubt that this will be the case.
The vast majority of Muslims is simply interested in practicing their religion peacefully, we should not confuse them with the few extremists.
It does not seem to me that the majority of Muslims are so intolerant against our society. We cannot confuse a few extremists with those who peacefully practice their religion.
How would you feel if on Sundays to go to church you had to go to a place far from home?
No Muslim has ever said that Italian women should wear the veil.
The real oppression is to forbid a person to profess their religion, as sanctioned in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The veil is not imposed by Islam, at most by oppressive regimes that with the true nature of Islam have nothing to do.
There is no invasion, the Muslim population in Italy does not exceed 5%.
Islamists represent a very low percentage of the Italian population, there are 10 mosques compared to more than 66,000 churches, so what data are you referring to?
The choice to wear the veil is free and it is up to Muslim women.
Muslims cannot use force to spread their principles, a sura of the Koran says that. Also, another sura proclaims religious tolerance.
In my experience, having known many Muslims, I must say that no one seemed particularly interested in organizing a coup to take power in Italy.
Muslims in Italy are about 2% of the population. I find it difficult to think that they become a majority. And in any case many Muslim women do not wear the veil.
Wearing the veil is a choice for the Muslim woman, its imposition or its prohibition on the other hand, are the result of oppression.
Do you know the number of Muslims in Italy? I do not believe they are so many to be able to 'impose' Islam on us. Historically are Christians who travel the world trying to convert others.
1. Why should Muslims impose their beliefs? 2. Women are not obliged to wear the veil. It is a free choice.
Could you give me a source at the base of a such strong statement? Because to me it does not appear that there is this trend going on.
We must invest in integration policies that allow us to bring together different cultures.
In almost all Muslim countries the veil is a choice (of the woman or of the family) is not imposed by law. It is in Iran.
Not all Muslims impose the veil on women.
Explain better what do you mean. Based on what do you make these claims?
In Islam, a woman can choose to wear the veil or not. Furthermore, the Quran teaches good Muslims to respect other religions.
The Koran teaches to the faithful to tolerate other religions and to respect them. Muslims can only transmit their own principles, but without using force.
If well worn, the veil can be very elegant.
The veil is not mandatory in most Muslim countries. Let alone in countries with a quite different tradition.
The Muslim population in Italy amounts to less than 3% of the total. I do not think it is a number that would allow them to take the power in a few years.
Do you have any evidence that it happened in any European country, including those in which Muslims are more numerous?
This statement that you express in this comment is false. Where did you get this information?
The path of integration ensures that the respect for individual human rights is acquired. Living with us, and the example we give in this regard will also open their society.
All extremism cause hatred, even racists hate those who are not like them.
Apart from a small intollerant portion, most Muslims are interested only in practice their religion peacefully.
Well, you want to send in the middle of the sea poor persons, who hates whom?
Do you suffer from some nightmare or go backwards with the time machine, to the stone age?
I met Muslims and they have no feeling of hatred towards Catholics.
Muslims don't hate Christians. Christians have much in common with Muslims in the religious field. Furthermore, the Koran proclaims religious tolerance.
The hatred against the West is not necessarily religious: much of this hatred has been developed as a result of the actions of Western countries at their home.
Muslims don't hate Christians. Some people, fanatical and radicalized want to cancel the other, it is on those that is necessary to act.
Were you threatened with death as a Christian?
It does not seem to me that most Muslims hate Christians: only a fraction kills for the faith, but can we consider them truly religious?
Not all Muslims are against Christians, the ones you mention are only a small part that does not represent the Islamic religion.
Muslims don't hate Christians, generalization is never good!
Tolerance of others' religions must be mutual. You cannot convict a person based on his faith.
The Muslims respect Christianity. Jesus is for them a prophet like Muhammad.
I'm sorry if you have had such a dramatic experience, I assure you that living together may also be non-traumatic, and that in most cases it is.
It's not absolutely true. There are millions of perfectly integrated Muslims.
Aren't you the one who hate Muslims?
If you refer to extremists those exist in every religion and faith, it has nothing to do with Islam.
It is ridiculous that as a result of a few extremists there are people who say these things.
And to think that a certain Jesus said that we are all equal, but someone must have misunderstood.
Do not you think you're exaggerating?
You should read less novels of political fiction. The idea that Muslims want to kill all the Christians is meaningless.
Do you ever met a Muslim who has told you to hate Christians?
Those that make attacks are not motivated by religion but by fanaticism that has nothing to do with religion, if not as an excuse.
In the UK there were in 2018 71,000 incidents of violence against Muslims. Perhaps there are more Christians who hate Muslims, don't you think?
In almost all Muslim countries there are Christian churches. Islam isn't intolerant against Christianity.
How can you say that they want to kill us all?
We must encourage the encounter between different cultures.
In the Koran it is clearly said that Christians and Jews should be respected.
Let's not generalize. Being a Muslim does not mean being criminals and terrorists.
The image that the media give of Islam, as a warmongering religion, which seeks to conquer the West and to fight Christians in the world, is false and instrumental. It was clearly said to Vatican Radio by the great imam Ahmad al-Tayyib, recently received from Pope Francis: 'Islam has nothing to do with terrorism. And those who kill Muslims and even kill Christians have misunderstood Islam texts either intentionally or through negligence. ' the University of Cairo that he heads is committed to clarify the concepts of the Koran, which are diverted from armed movements that use violence and terrorism, claiming to work for peace. 'we cannot blame religions,' added the Grand Imam, 'because of the deviations of some of their followers.'.
This statement that you express in this comment seems wrong. Could you send me the source where you have obtained it?
Muslims and Christians can live together pacefully.
Christians have set up crusades under the excuse of 'exterminating the infidels', we never heard about Muslims doing something like this.
Islam also mentions Jesus as a prophet, it never claimed to want to eliminate Christians, you hurt all of us saying things like that.
The majority of Muslims live together peacefully with Christians without creating any problem. Terrorists in most cases were not even practicing Muslims.
In the Quran, there is no sura ordering Muslims to kill people who do not believe in Allah. There is also a chapter which enunciates a principle of religious tolerance.
Muslims do not hate Christians. They simply profess a religion different from ours that, however, is based on love and brotherhood.
I read a lot of anger in your words, maybe we should all learn to be more open and sympathetic towards others.
I think you read too much ministry official propaganda.
Although many newspapers tend to create this impression, non-tolerant Muslims are very few. Most do not want to impose their religion.
Muslims do not hate Christians. Indeed they want to co-exist peacefully. In their sacred text, it is indicated that those who follow another religion can safely do it, without the two religions entering in conflict.
Have you ever been in an Arab country?
There are definitely (few) people who hate Christians. There are Christians who have killed and destroyed entire Muslim countries, raped their daughters and killed their wives.
And reading it we can say that Christians hate Muslims.
Are we still in the Crusades? I thought it was 2019 .
Muslims do not hate anyone, they pray God as Christians, individuals sometimes hate and kill.
From where do you obtained this information?
The Koran is a book similar to the Bible, written in Arabic. No one wants to kill their own brothers of faith.
Actually, Muslims have varied and beneficial business relations with the West, I do not think they want to kill us.
But who says it has to be our future? Religions can live together!
The largest group of foreigners in Italy is Romania that profess Orthodox - Christian faith.
The majority of immigrants in Italy is Catholic.
I do not think so, we westerners will arrive sooner to destroy the world.
Instead it is a sign of respect, not all of us profess the same religion.
The public school is laic: the crucifix should not really be there.
But a lack of respect to whom?
Italy is a secular state. Our Constitution says that, so each school can decide whether to put the crucifix or not. In France, it is forbidden to show any religious symbols in schools. Everyone in Italy has the right to profess any religion.
Italy is a laic state and as such, schools and public offices should be free from any religious influence. Culture is too precious to be sold to these guerrillas.
At school should be taught to respect everyone, regardless of their religion.
School is a laic place. The crucifix is ​​a religious symbol, it has nothing to do with the school.
The one about the crucifix removed from schools is a fake news that people like a lot at Christmas.
In that sense there are more crucifixes in schools? To me it does not appear.
The public education should be laic in respect of all religious confessions.
In most schools the crucifix is ​​still there.
Italy is a laic state and being a place of education for children should be an occasion of comparison between cultures, beyond these controversies.
No one is preventing you to profess your religion, you can continue to be a Christian even if the crucifix isn't in schools.
Forcing to have in front of the eyes a religious symbol is respect.
I believe that the crucifix in school is a lack of respect for those who are not believers or have a different faith than Christianity.
Italy is a laic state. The crucifix should not be at school.
The school is not a religious place but an educational place.
At my child's school there is, and children from Muslim families do not say anything.
The school is a lay institution, there should be no religious symbols of any kind.
For all I know, the crucifix is ​​still in most schools.
I am not aware that they have been removed. From what can you do this statement?
In countries like France at school it is forbidden any religious symbol, from the crucifix to the islamic veil.
It seems to me that the shame of the Italian school are very different.
At school there are people of all faiths and even atheists. Why there should be a crucifix?
Is the presence of the crucifix the real lack of respect in a laic state.
Italy is a laic country, so in schools there should be no religious symbols otherwise symbols of all religions should be exposed.
In some schools there is.
To my knowledge, It does not result to me that crucifixes disappeared in schools.
Italy is a laic country, the school is a place for education and dialogue, not of worship.
Among all the problems of education in Italy, which are just so many, I would not put the crucifix, which is a religious symbol and as such should not be in schools in a laic state.
Italy is a laic state, impose a religious symbol may instead be a lack of respect for who profess a different religion.
We live in a laic state, it is right that the crucifix is ​​not obligatory.
Look, there are still.
No one wants to impose to remove the crucifix in the classroom. It would be nice that at school everyone would be free to believe what they want and children could share the beauty of having different cultures.
I do not see how in a secular country the lack of religious symbols in schools can be a lack of respect.
Disrespectful is to impose the crucifix to me, an agnostic.
The crucifixes are still present in schools, as well as in other public places, so I do not see the problem.
Freedom of thought, conscience and religion means that you have the right to profess your beliefs, not to impose it on others with symbols introduced in schools.
A person living in conditions of deep social problems and emigrated to another country exports its tradition and religion, and want to maintain them, exactly as the host country wants to maintain its own. This does not mean submission, it means coexistence, exchange, mutual enrichment.
Islam, like Christianity, it has a message to bring: everyone is free to choose whether to listen or not, but no one has the ability nor the will to subjugate anyone.
The largest mosque in Europe built decades ago, is situated in Rome, and has never created problems or competition.
The number of mosques is proportional to the number of Muslims permanently present in our area.
And who wins what do they do, resuscitate?
The construction of mosques can also facilitate the control of the state on any possible situation of radicalization.
There are very few mosques in Italy compared to the churches.
Try to inform yourself and you will see that it is not so. Indeed, precisely because the mosques are not so common is difficult to many Italian Muslims to reach their place of worship.
The ratio between churches and mosques is obviously unbalanced in favour of the first.
Do you know how many mosques are there in Italy? 10, we have instead 66,994 churches, so what are you referring to exactly?
How many mosques have you seen in your neighbourhood?
Christian churches can establish peaceful relations with Muslims. If we do not learn to talk we can never get to the peaceful co-existence.
Unfortunately, we don't permit them to build mosques, showing that we are the intolerant fundamentalist.
Competition but we're not talking about bars at all, uh?, there is freedom of worship in Italy.
Not all Italians are Christians, and I think that the churches in Italy are not lacking. Certainly, it does not seem trivial to build as many mosques in the near future.
Competition in what sense?
Everyone has the right to pray in their own place of worship. Their mosques are not competing with the Christian churches, even between the two religions we can establish a relationship of dialogue.
I do not think that religion is a matter of competition.
But where? But why do you have always to say the usual falsehoods https://www.bufale.net/home/precisazioni-moschee-italia-chiese-arabia-saudita/.
There are Catholic churches all around the world, even in non-Christian countries, so why would not be correct to allow the construction of mosques in Italy?
Do you say that they are competitors on the market of religion?
The number of mosques is proportionate to the amount of Muslims in the area.
In Italy Muslims are one million and three hundred thousand: it seems logical that they have places in which to pray.
They create spaces to practice their religion, I do not think that would bother the Catholics that have already their spaces.
The presence of mosques does not threaten our religion.
Better that people can pray in mosques open to the public rather than in secret.
Could you tell me exactly a source that would indicate a growing number of bulit mosques ?
We are a civilized country, why should we deny the construction of places of worship to religious communities?
If you would inform yourself and you would make a comparison between the number of churches and the number of mosques you would understand that what you are saying is false. And the number of mosques is far inferior to the number of churches.
The number of mosques in Italy is totally insignificant.
The number of Muslims who have committed certain massacres is insignificant compared to the total number of people living in our cities. Generalizing is always wrong, while condemning the individual crimes.
Why where there is a Muslim community there shouldn't be a mosque?
There is no contest between mosques and churches.
Italy is a secular country and Muslims have every right to build places of worship in which the community can come together and pray.
There are also many Italian Muslims why we stop them from practising their beliefs? Why we give this opportunity only to Catholics? Why mosques bother you? And then I assure you that the number of mosques is negligible compared to the number of Catholic churches.
How would you feel if for going to church on Sunday you should go to another region?
In Italy, there is freedom of worship, so anyone is free to practice their religion by any means that seems appropriate, then also with building places of worship.
No, it is a need that can be shared, no Catholic faithful is competing with others to pray.
And where did you took the data to make this statement from?
It does not seem to me that there are so many mosques in our cities. Could you provide me some data about their number?
The Muslim population has the right to practice their beliefs.
Like all faithful they need places of worship. Christians have churches all over the world.
I do not see the problem, so we are all happy, they pray to their god and we pray to ours.
From what source did you obtain this information? Can you send me the sources, please?
Our constitution guarantees freedom of worship, so it makes sense that Muslims have places of prayer for them.
It does not appear to me that so many mosques have been built in recent years, yet it would be a better way also to isolate the extremists.
Why must we create a competition between different religions? Wouldn't be better to establish a peaceful coexistence?
The number of mosques in Italy is insignificant compared to the churches and there are no data to show that this number is likely to increase so sharply.
It does not appear to me, actually.
Do you not believe that everyone should be free to practice their religion?
The number of mosques is related to the number of the faithful.
Competition is good for the free market, perhaps with more choice, we earn heaven.
More competition = lower prices and cheap indulgences.
The right to worship is provided by our constitution. It is right that they have ufficial and suitable places for prayer, where everything takes place according to established norms with local authorities.
The right of worship is universal and I do not believe that Muslims couldn't profess freely their faith in Italy. We have to talk to them and not be afraid to approach. Only so, we will reach the total tolerance between religions.
No one wants to have more places of worship of others. There are citizens who want a place of worship close to home.
Try to see how many churches there are in Italy and how many mosques. If you lived in Dubai, and the situation was reversed, wouldn't you want that there was at least one church?
I do not see which competition can exist between the churches and the mosques, we can go to one or the other according to our faith. They are not supermarkets that offer discounts.
Let's hope they call good architects, my parish seems a huge garage of concrete.
The number of mosques is irrilevant in relation to the number of churches.
Who requires the construction of mosques is not interested in competing with those who go to church, but simply in creating a place to practice their religion.
It's right that every religion can have a place of worship in which to profess their beliefs, as required by our constitution.
Everyone must be able to express their faith.
I've never heard such a claim.
Did you know that their prophet in 600 AD established a government, together with Jews, that respected the freedom of religion of all citizens. If there are Muslims who seek the opposite, they are a minority, since their religion, such as Christianity, takes as its model the spiritual leaders.
Where did you hear this news?
They ask only to be able to practice their religion.
Religious freedom means having the right to practice one's own religion. Catholics have the right to go to church as well as Muslims in mosques, the two things can co-exist!
I have not seen recently closed churches, but maybe I'm wrong. Can you tell me why do you think so?
Do you know the case of a Muslim who tried to close a church? I would be very curious to hear a story about that.
The best answer to this fear is to defend your religion, not attack Islam; do you attend church regularly?
Impossible! We have too many!
Not true, Muslims are not invaders for definition, and Christianity is still the first religion in Italy.
It is not correct to speak of Islamic invasion because according to the 'Pew research center' in Italy Islamists are 4.8% of the population.
I exhort you to do some research and you'll find that only a small part of the Italian population is of islamic faith.
On what data is based this statement?
Hi, I understand that the perception of the phenomenon is sometimes amplified by some media, but the number of Muslims in Italy is even less than 5%.
From what do you presume it? Did you inform yourself well before writing the comment? I ask you to perform in-depth research.
Talking of 'Islamic invasion' assumes that all the people who come are Muslim, well it isn't like that! Africa is not Islam.
It would be interesting to have information about this, can you provide them?
Are you really sure? I suggest that you inform yourself before you write something. In this way, you do not have the risk to seem a liar.
It does not seem to me to see many Muslims around.
I do not think that talking about invasion is correct. Most migrants that arrive in Italy are distributed in the rest of Europe, where Italy is second last in number of immigrants for inhabitant.
How do you figure this invasion?
Could you indicate where you easily meet Islamic?
Hi, could you better explain what you mean by Islamic invasion? Could you tell me some datas that support this statement?
I do not think so. The Muslim population in Italy constitute only 4% of the total population. I wouldn't consider it an invasion.
It seems to me rather that is taking place a real invasion of fake news.
Hello, could you give me a figure on the number of Muslims in Italy?
In Italy Muslims are less than 5%, I personally would not call it an invasion.
Hi, actually Muslims in Italy do not even reach 5% and among them there are also Italian citizens who profess this faith.
That's why I, a woman, can no longer drive!
There is a growing climate of fear against the Islamic foreigners. Actually foreigners resident in Italy who profess the Orthodox Christian religion are the majority (nearly two million), followed by Muslims (less than a million and a half).
Speaking of invasion isn't very correct, considering the number of people who have settled permanently in Italy after they arrived in recent years. Our law guarantees the right of everyone to live their culture in freedom: this is the definition of enrichment: bringing something that was not there, that can teach something new.
Hello, actually the data show that the majority of immigrants in Italy are Christian-Orthodox and non-Muslim faith: the situation is very diverse and I do not think we can speak of invasion when the number of Muslims in Italy (including Italian citizens) is just under 5%.
What kind of changes do you fear that could happen?
What has sharia that does not convince you?
To what immigrants do you refer in particular?
1.on what basis you define this an invasion? 2. Can you explain your point of view?
Could you explain your point of view?
Do you think that it's plausible to think that our country in a few years will be controlled by Muslims, that they will impose us the way in which they think, dress, live .?
It cannot be considered an invasion because the data show that the percentage of Muslim foreign immigrants in Italy in 1993 was 32% and remains 32% nowadays. The percentage is not increased, so there wasn't a significant increase of Muslims.
Actually, the largest foreign community in Italy is Romanian.
Hi, since in fact, the number of Muslims in Italy is equal to less than 5%, most of them profess their faith in full freedom and respect for cultures and faiths of others, without wanting to impose anything.
For who would represent an enrichment?
Hi, data actually affirm that most of the immigrants are of Orthodox Christian faith and Muslims are less than 5%. In addition to the fact that those who claim to want to impose sharia does not seem like they really inspire from the assertions made by their religion.
Where did you obtain this information from? Did you check if your source was reliable, because the official data deny an increase of the Muslim immigrant population in Italy.
Hello, actually the couscous is also linked to our tradition, especially in south Italy and it is not a matter to impose a practice typical of another religion. Many food experts have recommended the introduction of this food (still a free choice) in school canteens because it is considered a suitable food for healthy nutrition.
Hello, the case to which I believe you refer would not be absolutely a defined choice based on religious reasons, but for food health issues.
Hi, do you really believe that the decision to introduce in a part of the school menu a food anyway considered healthy as the couscous is a symptom of an alleged will to impose a religion?
We must maintain our identity respecting their, and vice-versa.
Living together starting from different roots and the cultural precondition is possible and it will be increasingly frequent and daily, but not easy, we must learn both us and them.
I think that they try to keep their identity and I do not see anything wrong with it, where their customs conflict with ours we create space for dialogue.
The cultures can co-exist if there is the value of mutual respect.
I think as long as they do not force us to eliminate churches and ham there is nothing to be alarmed about;).
The idea of ​​blow someone up is itself crazy.
But who? It seems to me that, like many others, they simply want to express their faith freely.
Unfortunately, terrorism is a reality, but it has nothing to do with religious faith. The terrorists, the fanatics, the violent exist in every country, in every culture, in every religion.
Your statement is a lawsuit.
Hatred does nothing but feed hatred.
Careful don't trip over, there is a risk being blind;).
The fanatics represent only a small part of the Muslim population. If you do some research, you will notice that Islam preaches peace. So, why commit violence on innocent people?
Why do you want to do something so cruel? Where does your hatred come from?
Revenge is always wrong. Also it is not correct to generalize because the majority of Islamic terrorism victims are Muslims themselves.
I do not share your statement. Muslim migrants arriving in Italy seek help because they are the first to be persecuted by the true fanatics in their home countries.
Nothing is achieved with violence. We must be able to dialogue and find a point of cohesion between the two religions. Fanaticism is not true Islam. The Muslims who arrive in Italy are the first to be persecuted by the real extremists.
Are you saying you would go with great pleasure on dead bodies?
There are more civil ways to constructively criticize, these lies also harm those who utter them.
Who are you to judge in such a merciless manner, God Almighty?
Without a little bit of common sense dangerous statements get out, it is better to think before shoot at random.
Oh yes? Then they are in good company of sovereign who would like to close doors and gates.
Fanaticism is always dangerous, but you do not fight, when there is, with more fanaticism.
There is no Islamic invasion of the West. If many of the migrants are Arabs it depends only on the fact that most Middle Eastern countries are affected by crises and wars.
Actually, terrorism is not an Islamic phenomenon: in America, there is an attack every day, not in the name of Allah.
Being of Arab origin does not mean being terrorists, avoid generalizations that lead only to more hatred.
Many victims of terrorism are Arab people, as many terrorists in history have been Italian. Victims and offenders, including terrorism, haven't a specific ethnicity or skin colour.
Not all Arabs are terrorists, in fact, many attacks damage also Arab people.
Generalizing has never led to anything good. I remind you that even in Italy we have had our terrorists. Saying that all Arabs are terrorists because of few individuals is like saying that all Christians are terrorists of the Red Brigades at home, for example.
The Islam itself is against terrorism of jihad, we must work with Islam, not criminalize it.
Stupid generalizations, serious and dangerous.
Don't confuse Islam with Isis. Religion does not lead to terrorism.
Napalm and weapons do nothing but generate hatred and hatred promotes terrorism. The answer should be just the opposite: try to resolve conflicts.
Classic phrases also manipulated by politics to achieve consensus. They are not proven facts but unfounded stereotypes that create only hatred toward a category of people. Would you like to be held up as a criminal or terrorist only according to your ethnic/geographical belonging? It is like saying that all the Campanians have Camorra and all the Sicily, Mafia.
But are we really still behind these bar's stereotypes ?
You cannot generalize and blame for the crimes of a few fanatics thousands of others innocent people.
Even in Europe, there is terrorism, what do we do? Should we throw napalm on us?
Responding with violence is exactly what terrorism aims.
In Italy we have had no recent attack by Arabs. Moreover, even in European countries where these despicable events took place, it was not an action of conquest, but only terrorist actions.
Generalizing is always wrong, while acknowledging how some crimes are horrendous. Many people try to integrate in our society or anyway they never intended to hurt anyone.
As if an American says 'Italians are all mobsters, we must respond with napalm'.
Violence is always wrong. Also it's repudiated in our constitution. This post is therefore contrary to the principles at the basis of our state.
Terrorism has no ethnic origin. Terrorism is a problem but ethnicity, religion, skin colour, borders are not.
Although in Italy we have tens of thousands of Muslim immigrants, I do not remember many cases of bombs on our territory. Do you have different information?
Many of the recent Islamist terrorist attacks were not made by Arabs. For example, Turks, Iranians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis etc. Are not Arabs.
Answering to violence with violence is not a solution.
Historically the most violent, bloody and oppressor population has been the Europe one, so I would say that we cannot generalize completely.
Can you tell me the source to which you drew, to say that the Arabs are all terrorists and want to conquer us with violence and bombs? To me it appears that ISIS is composed of violent, but they are a minority and an extreme fringe of this community, not the entire community.
The Arabs have no interest in conquering Europe. The majority want to live in peace, as the majority of Italians.
There is no better way to spread the terrorism that responding with violence.
I don't think responding to violence with violence has ever solved the problem; I wish however to point out that generalizations like the one you made are misleading, some Arabs are terrorists, as some Italians are mobsters, but not all Arabs are terrorists and not all Italians are mobsters.
Terrorism is a widespread phenomenon in the world, among Arab, European, American and many Asian and African peoples. It is not possible to consider all Arabs terrorists. There was terrorism also in Italy: are all Italians terrorists?
We Italians would never want to be generalized with the crimes committed by our fellow mobsters. Why should we do the same with foreign citizens or of other religions?
Islam is a religion of love, the fundamentalism of jihad is not Islamism.
So because of Red Brigades also all Italian would be terrorists, because of IRA even all Irish and due to the ETA even all Spanish? In short, here in Europe, we are quite dangerous!
I am not aware that there is a declaration of war to our country. We have, like all states, but much less than most of those in Europe, a small percentage of immigrants that are Muslim, about 3%.
What is this? A recipe for hell or the will of a serial killer?
In the Koran, there is not even a word that can legitimize or at least justify terrorism. I invite to read it to enrich the general culture.
Do you say that what leads to acts of terrorism is the country of origin? So, if you are born in Egypt you have smoothed the career?
Responding to violence with violence is never the best answer. And history should teach us. Also, it would be good to do not throw the baby out with the bath water. Terrorism is not just a given geographic or ethnic belonging.
Do you know by chance the anti-terrorism or prevention of radicalization policies? It's the West that creates the best conditions for the proliferation of extremism.
Arab countries have always condemned terrorist acts.
These are stereotypes and prejudices that kill any chance of comparison and that cause intolerance and unjustified hatred. Following the clichés is not constructive, we must inquire and open our mind.
You accuse them of terrorism and of wanting to conquer with violence and bombs, and then propose yourself violence and bombs . I do not think this will lead to something positive.
How many Muslims have you met in your life to be able to make this kind of judgment?
The Arabs are not all terrorists. The extremists represent only a small part of the total Muslim population. We should not generalize, but dialogue.
In reality, the vast majority of Muslims in Syria or Yemen, for example, of which terrorists are a tiny minority, suffers violence and is bombed. They are victims of profit at all costs, of our arms industry.
It's like saying that Italians are all mobsters and they deserve life imprisonment.
Selective Napalm? We throw it over our city and we hopeit will hit the Arabs?
Better a smart bomb. Oh, no. That threatens to hit you.
This statement is very cruel. Can you tell me if you strongly believe in this statement? Where does all this anger come from?
Who is really in charge to combat terrorism would not agree with you.
Terrorism cannot be fought with violence.
Really, with napalm. And then where? They are not all terrorists as you say, some belong to ISIS but others are people like you and me.
So when there were mafia attacks all the southern people were mobsters?
It does not seem correct to me to generalize. If some Arabs are terrorists, that does not mean they all are. Some Italian men kill their partners/wives, does this mean that we are a nation of uxoricides?
I understand the fear that all these dramatic events in recent years have caused, but you can never respond to violence with more violence or generalizations of this type.
Bombs and napalm are to ban for those who have not yet understood that we would all die.
Good evening, so you're telling me that you would burn with napalm Arab children?
I find your comment extremely violent, it worries me.
A criminal should be treated like a criminal, a person - even if with a religious belief different from mine - must be respected as a person.
Arabic, Islamic and terrorist are very different terms that we must learn to use. Arab: inhabitants of Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. Muslims: those who profess the religion of Islam Terrorists: Islam extremists.
Do you mean the saudis for arabs?
Good evening, I would be interested to read articles and studies on the Arab plan to conquer the West, could you add me links? Thank you.
Generalization is always misleading. Arabs are not all terrorists, some of them are; as if someone in the 70s said that Italians were all members of the Red Brigade. Battisti, who in recent days has been arrested and others were, but they were still a handful of people when compared to the number of inhabitants of Italy, so we are wrong every time we throw the baby out with the bath water.
We have hundreds of muslims workers that are very quiet in Italy, are they all dormant terrorists?
Excuse me, but why should the Arabs want to conquer us with violence and bombs?
You're generalizing baseless. Violence cause violence, unfortunately, so between responsible and advanced adults always choose the dialogue option. So we won't return to the Middle Ages.
We bombard also Lombardy because there are corrupts and Campania because there is the Camorra? For a few guilty we cannot generalize.
The Islamic terrorists actually are not very religious, they are second generation, grown in the absence of values ​​and marginalization and they seek refuge in a radicalization that leads them to terrorism.
There are Arab terrorists, as there are English terrorists, Italian and French. These stereotypes won't help us to fight terrorism.
The Italians are all thieves and mobsters, the Swiss are all punctual, Africans are all poor, all Germans are Nazis. But on what basis do you make these statements? .you are just following clichés without any foundation.
What do you mean with the term 'Arab'? If you refer to who profess Islamic faith, not necessarily they coincide with the inhabitants of the Arab countries, as in these countries also live minorities of Christians.
If you refer, as I imagine, to Islamic terrorists, it is true, there are Arab terrorists. Just as there are Italian mafia, but not for that I identify with them.
As Italians are all mobsters, the Germans are all Nazis, but as you will know these are prejudices, such as yours on Arabs.
In Europe we have different forms of terrorism eta, ira, even in Italy we have had various forms of terrorism, black and red. Even the Mafia has used terrorist strategies.
It would be like saying that all Italians are mobsters and kill people with a shotgun or dissolve children in acid. You can never generalize.
As specified in the reports of various associations such as Amnesty report, the violation of human rights is far distributed in the world. Western states do not shine for lack of violence, especially to foreign countries.
I personally know the beautician Laila, the waitress Hind, the gardener Malik. All Muslims, no terrorist.
There is no attempt at conquest by the Arabs, rather are Westerners and china that conquer and exploit.
The Arabs are not all terrorists, a generalization like this is dangerous, as it is dangerous to think to solve the problem of terrorism by answering with the same violence.
Did you know that the only terrorist attacks in Italy were made by Italians?
Responding to hatred with hatred is self-destructive.
Arab population is full of differences inside itself, they are not all terrorists.
Islam is a religion manipulated by terrorism that uses it as a shield. The same thing happened in the years of lead in Italy with terrorism that exploited political ideologies and parties.
Napalm. And they are the terrorists?
With violence and wars nothing good is gained, we must instead seek a peaceful solution. If you inform yourself, you will find out that the Arabs are not all terrorists and some are not even Muslims.
No Arab country has declared its intention to conquer Italy, they know that wouldn't be worthwhile to anyone .
Excuse me but how many Arabs have you know personally?
Do not you think it is unfair to blame an entire category of persons defined by you 'Arab' for the actions of a few? Crime and terrorism, unfortunately, have always existed and always have different colours and ethnic groups. There are Arab terrorists as Italian terrorists.
The phenomenon of terrorism is surely to keep under control, but do you know how many Muslims there are in the world, and how many terrorists?
Although terrorism is a phenomenon that has to be monitored not all Arabs are terrorists and generalize in this way leads to a lot of ignorance.
Although there are certainly Muslims who have committed horrendous crimes, I find it unfair to generalize and condemn an ​​entire category: most people have never hurt anyone and they risk paying because of these prejudices.
Certainly terrorism is a problem, but killing is definitely not the best solution.
The napalm? So when they are still 'at home'? How sad, stupid generalizations.
The number of mosques is not even remotely comparable to the number of churches, let's not panic.
The Arabs are a people rich in culture and history and also in contradictions as the so-called Westerns and inciting hatred is uncivilized and blind.
Terrorism has no culture or ethnicity, how do you accuse of terrorism an entire population? What data do you have?
Throwing the baby out with the bath water creates a useless hate.
The Arabs are several hundred million if they were all terrorists they would have already destroyed Europe. The terrorists are a minority, which often damages other Arabs: in the attacks committed by Arabs, there have been many more Arab victims than European victims. Much is said about the terrorist attacks in Europe, but there are many more attacks in Asia and Africa.
You would really use incendiary bombs to set fire to people because someone among them could have mental problems?
Arab is only a generic word precisely as Europeans or Americans that does not consider the many differences existing and in any case, sow fear is the true gesture that should be condemned.
A despotic statement that not even Attila would share.
Where did you obtain this information from? Can you send me the source?
The vast majority of the nearly two billion Muslims are normal people, like me or you, absolutely peaceful. Few radicalized individuals should not make us generalize. In Italy we also had the indigenous terrorism, this should not allow anyone to do the Italian = terrorist juxtaposition.
Do you really think that terrorism is an ethnic character? And the mafia, for example, how do you explain it?
All terrorists? My aunt married an Arab man, have two wonderful children and live in the United States. The Arab man in this case has only won the heart of my aunt, no violence or bombs.
Good evening, the main victims of the terrorist attacks are the inhabitants of Arab countries. For the most part, then, they are victims, not terrorists.
I do not believe that they are replacing us, because in Italy the Islamic religion population is only 4%. Women can choose to wear the veil or not, and only the most radical forms of Islam require the use of the burqa.
Hi, do you think that it's really possible to talk about substitution when the number of citizens of the Muslim faith (including Italian) does not even reach 5% of the total population?
But who? Where? In what home?
The percentage of Muslims in Italy is 5%, so I do not think it's possible to think that they are replacing us.
There are more than 800 churches only in Rome, and about 10 mosques (of which only 5 with the minaret). They are a minority: none (that I know) has ever had the need to build a new church, but everyone is entitled to a place where to practice their religion. The fact that the Islamic community requires that their right is respected does not mean that they are becoming more than the Christians, or more powerful.
I do not think that people requesting political asylum in Italy come here for no reason. They flee because in their homeland there wasn't a situation that favoured their stay. We cannot talk about a replacement because the Muslim population represents only a small part of the total Italian population. Men do not hit women, and only the most radical forms of Islam impose the burqa.
Hi, I do not think that those who profess the true Muslim faith can admit violence against women or non-respect for freedom of religion. The Koran makes no references in this sense, those who act in this way are doing it going against the same provisions of belief that say to be inspired.
Yeah, because here in Italy no one has ever beat his wife .
Have you ever felt that soon it will be necessary to convert to Islam to keep living in our society?
Could you tell me please where did you obtain this information? Because they are not true.
There is no replacement in Italy because Muslims are less than 5% of the population.
No one has the right to beat his wife, Italian or Muslim. It is illegal, and the law punishes everyone equally.
Hi, his statement is very strong, could you explain better what you mean by 'replace in our house'?
If it was true, we should rather be concerned to defend these women.
Hello, actually the number of Muslims in Italy amount to just under 5% of the total population: do you believe that it is possible to talk about replacing?
Violence against women is mostly domestic, made by Italian close to the victims.
Muslims have never raped anyone only because they are Muslims.
The highest number of rapes on Italian women is committed by Italians.
The frequency of violence is related to social status more than to religion. Inclusion and social differences are a basic bigger problem from which derive these problems.
Our whom? If it relates to the Italian women I have and I do not feel safe in reading your words. The problem is not Muslims, but the too local mentality in which man feels the woman his property.
Our women whose? Forgive me, but I am a woman, I do not belong to anyone but myself, and I do not think that being Muslim makes someone a violent criminal.
In Italy the highest number of rapes is commited at home, from friends, partners or relatives.
But you know, I could almost agree, provided that on the Italians that do the same thing, which is unfortunately a large group, it would be imposed the same penalty, and instead the Italian macho . But come on! Do you read newspapers that tell about violence on women and feminicide?
I understand the fear linked to these horrendous crimes, but they should be condemned regardless of nationality.
Think to castrate people for their religious beliefs and not for their individual responsibilities seems the product of a really retrograde mentality. Certainly not typical of the advanced West.
Good evening, from your comment I deduce that rape Italian women should not be so much violent mens, but members of the Islamic religion. So it is something related to religion? Not a sexist and violent culture?
The most severe forms of violence are made by partners, relatives or friends. The rapes are committed by partners in 62.7% of cases, in 3.6% and 9.4% by relatives of friends. We are talking about Italians.
I am an Italian woman, and I feel neither a propriety of you nor threatened by Muslims.
The rapists of women have nothing in common except the male gender.
By far the vast majority of the violence is the work of Italians. Among foreign immigrants, on top of the list are the Romanians, namely community non-Muslim citizens. So what you say is wrong.
The Muslims? Which? All? This statement is madness.
The problem is not Muslims, but the chauvinist mentality that we Italians are soaked with, which sees the woman as an object.
It's not just Muslims who rape women. The punishment that you propose does not seem effective to me. The judge of a court decides the real punishment for a rapist.
Not all Muslims commit such terrible crimes, we must respect those that want to integrate normally doing nothing wrong.
Unfortunately, violence against women is a cross fact that happens in every country, in every corner, and the victims are us, us women, so let's not make it an issue of nation, ethnicity, religion, a crime is a crime, whoever does it and castration does not really seem the solution to the problem.
Are you worried that Italians may have competitors? It seems that italian men get busy, a feminicide every 72 hours!
A phrase that denotes a profound ignorance or a perfect bad faith because who offends women are members of the male gender in every place.
Do you propose castration even for the two police officers in Florence who raped two foreign tourists (assuming that they are found guilty definitively)?
The statistics state that the rapists are almost always Italian.
Women do not need protection from violence because they belong to a specific population, they need protection in general.
Also italians rape, are we going to castrate all of them?
And for the Italian rapists what do you propose? Because they represent the majority of the cases.
Gender-based violence is not an Islamic problem, it's a social problem of all.
We rape our women, actually.
Quite right! To each one their own women to rape, Italian women to Italians!
The Koran condemns violence on women: who does it violate religious norms. Those who abuse women, Italians or foreigners, Christians or Muslims, respect neither the law nor the religion.
Of course it's a lie, a few cases are not the rule.
Men's violence against women is a problem, but not connected in any way to religion or colour of skin. As not all men are rapists. No generalization is ever 100% true.
The rapist is a typical Italian product, I would say.
Good evening, think that the figures show that 4 of 5 women are raped by Italians. Can you bring data to support his theory?
Castration is not provided by our legal system.
What estimate do you have about it? Do you know data on rapes in Italy?
The Muslim religion does not plan to rape women.
Hi, are you suggesting castration as a punishment in a civilized country like Italy?
And the cases of violence made by Italians? How do you explain them according to your logic? Do we also castrate them?
Well, if we must castrate all Italians who raped and beat their women, then we should put in jail several of them, because unfortunately when you beat and molest a woman in Italy, even in trials are the women that take a beating.
To belong to the Muslim religion does not mean being criminals, do not come across in these dangerous clichés.
Unfortunately, violence against women has no nationality, color or religion. It must be fought in any case, not only if it is committed by a Muslim.
Then we must castrate even Italians who rape, who are in fact four times more than foreigners according to statistics.
Our Constitution thankfully forbids any form of physical violence against criminals. Castration, being an extreme form of violence, cannot be practiced in our state.
The sins of the individual cannot be sustained by the entire population.
On what data and statistics do you make this statement?
Crime does not depend on nationality and religion.
Rape and violence against women exist, unfortunately, in all the world, regardless of culture or geographic location.
A friend of mine married a Muslim man. He is always so sweet, takes her hand across the road, he opens her the door when entering a room. Gestures that I hardly see in all men. He will not be better than others because he's a Muslim, what I'm certain about is that he is not even worse because he's a Muslim. Let's stop identifying evil in such a banal way.
A rapist must be arrested as a rapist, and in any case, rapists are almost always Catholic.
Statistics show that over 80% of rapes on Italian women was committed by an Italian. Foreign rapists are 15.1%. Insert links, for example http://www.infodata.ilsole24ore.com/2018/07/25/la-violenza-le-denunce-gli-stupri-italia-la-statistica-della-paura/?refresh_ce=1.
Violence against women is a problem that does not refer to religion! What about all cases of violence committed by the Italians?
So you also agree with castration of all the husbands / boyfriends / violent fellow that have Italian origin?
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth and are we going back to the Middle Ages? Who commits an act so heinous must pay his debt, in prison, according to the law. You know that if any Italian woman beaten and raped by her husband, the partner and sometimes even by his father, would denounce the violence, prisons would be full of italian men. You've never seen 'Amore Criminale'? It is a great program that speaks about the subject, taking the cue from the most egregious cases, look for it on 'Raiplay'.
I do not know any Muslim who raped non-muslim women.
Generalizing is always wrong. I also condemn those who commit certain crimes, but regardless of their religious beliefs or their nationality.
Anyone who rape a woman in Italian territory should not be castrated, he will instead serve the sentence that our laws establish.
Crime has no color, nationality or religious affiliation. Throw the baby out with the bathwater is unfair and unfounded.
Castration according to belonging to a specific religion is something inhuman, being a Muslim does not mean being rapists.
Isn't this a cliché?
Think that Italians get married, but then they kill them with their children.
It seems to me that our women are raped by their relatives.
It's a horrendous fact, but to generalize and direct the hatred on a single community is infamous. The problem of violence against women, and unfortunately, these hideous crimes are mostly committed by Italians, at home.
The fact that there are criminals of the Muslim religion does not make all Muslims criminals, as well as the fact that there are Catholic criminals, does not make all Catholics criminals.
Some Muslims may commit crimes such as sexual violence, but not the whole Muslim population makes this kind of crimes. The punishment for the criminals can only be decided by a judge.
You cannot discuss while generalizing a population, the cases should be analyzed individually.
In comparison to cases of violence in Italy made by foreigners, which are 15% of the total, Italians have the 80% at home and proudly the world record as sex tourists in poor countries. The arrogance of money does not exonerate them, that's double violence.
Castration? Do you think it is a punishment to propose in a society that defines itself modern and respects the rights? To me, it seems a medieval punishment.
Well following his reasoning all Italians Catholics should also be castrated. There are and there have been plenty of criminals and rapists and, throwing the baby out with bathwater as you did, it would be good to castrate all of them so, if there are doubts, eliminate any danger.
Good evening, if I understand correctly, you're telling me that all adult men of Islamic faith present in Italy, rape or will rape Italian women? Can you bring in data that support your theory?
I would not make a religious issue, also Christians commit rape. The issue is not religious nor racial, those who behave in a certain way must be punished.
Actually, Muslim people are very selective and do not like Western women.
Neutering a rapist is like cutting the hand of a thief, the law of retaliation! These concepts are truly medieval!
If anything, we women must express what is harmful to us.
I do not think that sexual violences are committed only by members of a specific religion.
Unfortunately, many Italians commit rapes too.
Even the mother of idiots is always pregnant, this does not mean that we can assume the right to castrate it.
Instead, the non-Muslims that kill them, which punishment must serve, as they often are on the loose but dangerous?
Dear, the reality is quite different, unfortunately for women, and for all of us, most of the violence is committed by Italians, read here https://www.istat.it/it/violenza-sulle-donne/il-fenomeno/violenza-dentro-e-fuori-la-famiglia/numero-delle-vittime-e-forme-di-violenza.
Violence against women has always been a serious problem, which affects people of all ethnic groups, cultures and religions. It is certainly not a typical Muslim phenomenon.
On what basis do you do these statements? Actually, there are criminals everywhere and they have different ethnicities and religious affiliations. There are Italian rapists and Catholic priests that are paedophiles. But these cases should not allow us to identify all persons as criminals belonging to these categories.
But why follow the stereotypes and completely unfounded prejudices without facts and data?
This are shameful and horrendous crimes, many times perpetrated within the home and within the family.
It seems to me there isn't a prevalence of Italian women (if by 'our' you referred to those) raped by Muslims rather than by their fathers, husbands, confessors priests .
Women do not belong to no one but themselves and the best way to preserve them is to combat violence commited by men against them.
Our women mostly suffer abuses especially in the home, in some cases from childhood by a family member.
Criminal liability is personal, a whole category cannot pay for the errors of few.
Castration only for Muslims or also for all Italians who commit rape?
First Italians even in raping women?
It does not seem to me that are Muslims the ones that rape women in Italy.
It does not appear to me that there are data to support this theory.
Hi, the Muslim religion does not admit in its instructions so atrocious acts. Those who act in this way go against their faith, I would never equate criminals with everyone else who practice their religion peacefully.
Hi, even if I share any disapproval against those who commit acts of such atrocities, I invite you to reflect on the fact that in such cases it is necessary to go beyond any faith or nationality. There is no religion that admits such acts. Those who think that they can subjugate women and commit violence on them, in the name of an alleged faith, act as criminals, not as religious.
Hi, I still think that in these cases, religion or nationality have nothing to do with it. Those who commit these acts should be treated as criminals regardless of any other aspect.
Hi, I also condemn these acts that are so atrocious, but it seems to me unfair to put on the same boat all the people who form this religion. The Muslim religion does not permit such acts and their perpetrators should be considered criminals, regardless of their faith or nationality.
Do you know any Muslim person? I do not think he would like to hear you generalize in this way.
Islam is a religion, like Christianity and Judaism, it has nothing to do with terrorism, it is a dangerous and offensive generalization.
I have Muslim friends who do not think at all to blow themselves up.
Terrorism has no faith and nationality. It's a deviation that takes possession of individuals.
The fault of a few cannot fall on all Muslims, also they are the ones to be the first victims of terrorism.
So are we all mobsters, including you and I?
Terrorists are a very small part of Islam. Most Muslims fear terrorism as Christians.
Islam is not a religion of hate; terrorism has different roots.
I do not think that it is useful to generalize; you cannot say that they are 'all' terrorists!
Where did you get data to confirm this statement?
Terrorism is a serious problem but it has nothing to do with religion.
A bit like saying that we are all mobsters .
Do you have any statistic that proves that they are all terrorists? Or are you just generalizing.
The Islamic religion is not a religion that professes violence. Islamic terrorists have nothing to do with religion.
Being Muslim is not synonymous of terrorist.
It is never right to make generalizations.
We do not confuse people who migrate or flee, which are many, with frantic fanatics, which are few.
We treat terrorists as they are, criminal individuals. And let's leave all the other Muslims living peacefully in our cities alone.
I would say that assimilate Muslim immigrants to terrorists is a bit too much.
Generalizing is not right and does not lead to anything good: explain what is the faith of over a billion and a half people living in very different cultural contexts is complicated. Terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, but some persons give a wrong and extremist reading to it. The pillars of Islam are the declaration of faith of monotheism, the prayer, the alms, the fasting during the month of Ramadan, the pilgrimage to La Mecca.
It seems that there are always more people that believe that Islam is directly tied to terrorism. Actually, this belief is the result of a hard to kill stereotype that damages the dignity of Muslims and their religion which is actually like ours, a religion that has like basic principles the love of God/Allah and the brotherhood among men.
It is increasingly widespread the belief that there is a close link between Islam and terrorism. Actually, the Koran speak more about peace than war, more about rights than bans.
The terrorist criminals are only extremists parts justified by a deviated reading of Islam.
I see that is increasingly widespread a climate of fear against Muslims, even the media do not help to distinguish between the correct and mild faith that the majority of Muslims profess, the speculations of politicians, and the infamous use of the manipulators of Islam, that cover in blood the Middle East and North Africa. But Islam is not terrorism.
Terrorism is not a manifestation of Islam, but that is a religion of peace.
Terrorism has no faith and nationality. It's a deviation that takes possession of individuals.
Muslims are not terrorists !!! Terrorism is a tragic and violent deviation of the radicals, but it is important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.
Don't you believe in the work of our intelligence?
I do not think it is in their interest.
Do you really think that they have so many bombs?
I think it is the opposite. If the majority of Muslims feel accepted in their demands there will be less space for the fundamentalists.
The respect for each other born like this, accepting the other needs. This will stop fanaticism.
The cases of hate-mongering imams are very few, actually.
Allowing the construction of a mosque confers credit to us, it means respecting the other in all its diversity.
If the word femicide exists in our vocabulary it is because neither the Italian males are so quiet!
Istat data: 146 femicides in 2016, the number of previous years is similar. Of these 146, 77.6% is committed by Italians and 22.4% is committed by foreigners.
The imposition of the burqa regards the most extreme fringe of Muslims.
From what can you say that there is this desire from Muslims?
The veil is linked to a religious tradition, so, this would be possible if we share it with all.
The question of the veil is open. The same Muslim women in some countries are struggling to get rid of it, for example, in Iran. We have to support their struggle.
Well, but we can choose the color .! What's your favorite?
The vast majority of Muslim women living in Europe wear the veil voluntarily, respecting the religious beliefs of Islam, no one imposes it to them! There is no intention to convert to Islam Italian women.
I do not understand why you perceive this risk. Although some Muslims want to do that, we have a democratic state that protects us. We don't need to invent problems that do not exist.
The veil is an indument and personal symbol that every woman can choose to wear or not. For Iranian women is an object for participating actively in public life and to feel emancipated. I do not see it as a constraint.
The issue of the Islamic veil is complex, it is not a religious prescription but cultural. Islam has within itself many different positions on the subject.
I do not believe that this is the meaning of Islam; and for the more progressive Islam, the veil is an individual choice, not an imposition.
I do not think they have an interest in putting the veil on non-Muslim women.
They don't impose the veil even to the girls, so it seems to me that they respect the freedom to choose the veil. Does not it seem to you?
Why do you make this statement?
Italy provides religious freedom, no one can impose religious symbols of a different confession to anyone.
I do not agree. There are really emancipated Muslim women, do you know the models Gigi and Bella Hadid? They are Muslim, did you know?
The veil is a religious symbol, if you're not going to convert yourself it does not concern you.
Honestly, I see around many more Muslim women without burqa or veil than women dressed like Europeans.
In Italy as in all countries of the world, there are civilized and uncivilized people, you should support all women and help them to rebel, beyond that they freely choose to wear the veil or not.
How can you believe that there is someone who agrees to be beaten? We should focus on how to help these women whether they are veiled or not, whether they are Italian or not!
Italy unfortunately is full of unveiled women that are beaten by their men, where they should live?
No woman agrees to be beaten, be unable to break free from a state of violence and submission does not mean wanting to be in it. The veil if chosen freely should not be a problem for those who simply do not choose it.
Reading comments of women who can write such nasty statements is even sadder.
