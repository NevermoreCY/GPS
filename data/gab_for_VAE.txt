Using derogatory and profane language when referring to a child of African descent is unnecessary and offensive.
This is absolutely disgusting awful hate speech and you need to stop.
You know
Sexual orientation is a complicated issue and your use of offensive slurs  towards homosexuals detracts from your argument.
You need to stop. This language is hateful and unacceptable.
Everyone has a personal taste and I encourage you to not be so hateful toward things you just don't like.
You're toeing the line on language here. Please settle down.
It's one thing to use hate speech
Not every Muslim is of African descent; nor is it productive to use a racial slur to prove your point.

I don't think it's appropriate to use this language for something like a phone repair.

There is no need to lump everyone of a certain political ideology together in such a derogatory manner.
No need to be so aggressive
You could just not be cool with his ideas instead of resorting to the hate speech.
No one else is being insulting and there is no reason to imply that someone has a very serious condition because they disagree with you.
This talk is beneath everyone here. You can disagree without that sort of talk.
I can't even understand why you would talk to other people like this and why you would be so discriminatory towards a whole group of people
That's not very nice... unless you know him personally that's a lot of assumptions you are making
That's pretty extreme stuff that we can all do without. Try it.
What a nice thing to put on the internet for everyone to see. It just makes you look nasty uneducated and rude.

You shouldn't be bringing up sensitive topics. People have went through these kinds of things. To take them lightly is not acceptable.
I'm sorry you hold such intolerance toward people of different backgrounds
The person who wrote this is not in their right mind obviously.
There's no reason to insult others. They're not harming you in any way.
It's hard to take you seriously when you use that word.
This name calling does not do anything for the conversation it only curtails it and makes it impossible to respond. Be kind and open
I'd like to have this discussion with you but can't if you insist on using slurs.
You can make the same point but by using different words. This will allow people to more easily respond and discuss this with you.
This is a debate I'd love to have but I can't engage if you are going to use slurs.
Good job at having a conversation but the hate speech and name calling detracts from that. Instead work to provide proof of what you say
When you use that word it reflects poorly on your character.
Your comment does not add anything to the post. Instead of calling someone a name talk about what it is that you disagree with.
It's difficult to understand your stance when you use word like those.
Describe what you mean beyond basic phrases. Go deeper. Instead of using hate speech say something that furthers what you are saying.
Politics and political ideas such as the border wall or border guards are an issue everyone has differing opinions on. A very split issue.
Please remove the objectionable language and put in friendlier words.
Trump shouldn't have the freedom to tweet as he pleases. It's disrespectful on various levels. No President should use social media to vent.

Someones length of fame should not be concerning to those with no fame.

i'm done so i don't care anymore
Please express your thoughts without the damaging language.
Not everyone may agree on Nazism but everyone has varying beliefs. The same way not everyone agrees on politics or religion.
It's not necessary to use derogatory slang when you could just use the word 'person' instead.
That word is highly offensive and displays a lack of character.
That word has a lot of damaging history and I would really appreciate if you not say that.
Be thoughtful of those you might hurt using that word
The word you used is highly offensive to people with developmental disabilities.
Please refrain from degrading all women by using those choices of words.

Just because someone likes the same sex doesn't mean they are less than you.
The fact that you feel it necessary to use this language speaks volumes of you. This does nothing for your point.
Lets try making our point without resorting to name calling please.
Name calling someone you've never met isn't going to solve anything.
You do have the ability to speak with people in your post that will not make them feel shamed for their gender.
I would love it if you would please find a better way to describe what is in the photo without using the derogatory words.
There is a strong chance that your point becomes lost once your choice in words are used.
You do have the right to express you opinions but I could take you more seriously if you use less derogatory terms for people.
Using words that attack someone's disability don't contribute to understanding.
You come across as intelligent but it would be even better if you got rid of the derogatory and insensitive explanations to communicate.
Mentally challenged individuals tend to be highly intelligent so to use that as a way to describe something as stupid is ignorant.
You can explain in your opinion why somebody is wrong without describing people in slang terms it will reach a wider audience.
To act like those who follow a religion all behave the same way is to admit to your narrow mindedness.
I don't think using words that perpetuate a negative stereotype by race show care or promote understanding.
If you're trying to be funny it's better not disparage ethnicity's so that way more people can share in the humor.
You using a person's race as an insult only shows how narrow minded you are.
To define people by their religion shows your narrow mindedness as people act out of their perceived norms all the time
Explaining why you don't like someone is more beneficial than using coded speech.
Using sexuality as a way to insult something is only showing of your lack of creativity
If you have an opinion say what it is instead of just calling someone a name.
